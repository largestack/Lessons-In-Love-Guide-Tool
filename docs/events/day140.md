    s "Can’t you just fill out the paperwork for me? I’m tired and don’t even want to be here today."

    "As you can see, Makoto is briefing me on what I’m supposed to do both before and after the first new girl arrives."
    "It doesn’t sound like a load of extra work, but it does sound like {i}work{/i} in general, and I don’t remember signing up for anything like that."

    mak "All you need to do is sign your name and agree to take on responsibility for her."
    s "But what if she’s another Yumi? Two delinquents in one class is too many."
    s "In fact, one delinquent is too many. Can I trade in Yumi for someone else?"
    s "Sana is easy to deal with. Can I get another one of her?"

    scene mollyarrives3
    with dissolve

    mak "Actually, it’s funny you mention that. I was just thinking on the way to[school] this morning that Yumi’s gotten significantly better as of late."
    s "Better in what way? All she does is insult me and skip[school]."
    mak "Well, that’s true. But at least her grades are improving when she {i}does{/i} decide to show up."
    mak "You haven’t been actually {i}tutoring{/i} her, have you?"

    "Well...I guess there was that one time on the roof, but...I can’t think of any other time."
    "Either way, I’m not going to let Makoto know that."
    "I’ve felt myself slowly slipping to her bad side, so any chance I get to make myself look good, I will gladly take."

    s "Actually, my dear Makoto, I {i}have{/i} been tutoring Yumi. That’s why I’ve been so tired lately."

    mak "Huh...Is it wrong that my initial instinct is to call you a liar? I seem to have a harder time believing that than I should."

    with dissolve

    mak "Hmm...Upset isn’t the right word."

    "…"
    "Makoto vanishes into the classroom and I can hear the volume of the rest of the class go down a few notches once she does."
    "It’s hard for me to say how everyone else sees Makoto from their perspective, but it seems to me that, at the very least, she’s respected."
    "Or feared."
    "But either way, she’s able to change the mood of the room...And that’s always an impressive feat. "
    "…"
    "I sigh to myself and straighten out my blazer, getting ready to walk into the class."
    "But just as I’m about to open the door, I hear a set of quickened footsteps come to a sudden halt behind me."

    mo "Hmm...Interesting. Interesting."

    s "…"

    "She’s too perceptive. She must be eliminated."

    s "Are you sure you should be asking your new teacher something like that?"
    mo "I am not, sir. I will remain in-line like a good soldier."
    mo "Please forgive me. I’m often told that I lack a filter and say things that people from your country normally keep to themselves."
    s "That...might become problematic in some cases. But I guess it could be fun in a weird sort of way."
    s "What was that whole thing about this being the place where wishes come true, though?"
    mo "It’s from an anime, sir. "
    s "So you’re the type that watches anime?"
    mo "I love anime, sir. I would give my life for it. "

    s "Why was it you moved to Japan again?"
    mo "To serve you as my new master, sir."
    s "That sounds great and all, but what is the real reason?"

    if bonus == True:
        mo "It is my dream to become the lead heroine of a harem, sir."
        mo "I am prepared to put my body and soul on the line in pursuit of a love worth dying for. "
    else:
        mo "It is my dream to become the lead heroine of a dating game, sir."
        mo "I am prepared to do whatever it takes to make that dream come true."

    s "...Exactly how much anime do you watch, Molly?"
    mo "Enough to ruin real-life relationships."

    mo "Yeaaaah...I don’t really blame you. Hahaha..."
    mo "I can go overboard pretty easily. But I’ll try to keep it to myself in class so I don’t mess anything up for you."
    s "Oh, you don’t need to worry about something like that."

    scene mollyarrives11r
    with dissolve

    mo "Hm? What do you mean?"
    s "I don’t really take the same approach to teaching as most other people."
    mo "So is this one of those like, free-form learning thingamajigs?"
    s "I don’t really know what that means, but sure. We can go with that."

    scene mollyarrives12r

    mo "So it’s cool if I be weird in class?! Really?!"
    s "Uh...Well, yeah. I guess so. "

    "Scattered, awkward applause fills the classroom but I’m pretty sure it’s just Ami, Miku, and Futaba. "
    "Everyone else remains silent and watches as Molly takes her seat...right in the front of class."
    "Just when I was beginning to settle into my new, calm life as a teacher, someone like her shows up and sits as close to me as possible."
    "And now I can’t help but think of all the chaos she’s going to cause for not only myself..."
    "But for Rin, who is still crying out of embarrassment in the corner of the classroom."

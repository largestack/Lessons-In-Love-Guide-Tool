    to "I was originally going to sit in the back of the classroom to make sure I was not in anyone’s way, but...there is a girl who looks rather...frightening back there."
    ay "Oh, that’s just Yumi."
    ay "She's not really scary, but she’ll probably make fun of you for being rich or something. Either way, you can sit here."
    to "I see...I had no idea that simply being wealthy could actually prove disadvantageous in certain cases."
    to "But I suppose I can just bring my bodyguard to[school] from now on to avoid any confrontations with her."

    ay "You...probably don’t have to go that far, you know. It’s not like she’s going to attack you or anything."

    scene yasufirstday3
    with dissolve

    to "Oh...Yes, I suppose we never resolved that matter concerning your training facility."
    ay "Well...yeah. All this time, I kind of just figured it was a done deal. There’s no way my family can outspend yours when it really comes down to it."
    to "Well, you need not concern yourself with that anymore."
    ay "What do you mean?"
    ay "You're not saying what I think you're saying, are you?"
    to "To...further clarify, I was able to convince my father that I was no longer interested in karate."
    to "I've decided to learn something else instead."
    ay "But...why? You had to be pretty interested if things got to the point where you were literally about to hire a personal instructor and buy out a dojo."

    scene yasufirstday4
    with dissolve

    to "Change of heart, I suppose?..."
    to "I didn’t realize how important that place was to you when I first arrived."
    to "It took a lot of convincing to have my father slow down the process, but...I do hope that you’ll be able to continue having fun there...as we will no longer be needing it."
    ay "You...really did all that for me?"

    scene yasufirstday5
    with dissolve

    to "There’s no need to make a fuss over it."
    to "I’m sure it’s plenty apparent that I have a hard time picking up on certain things due to my upbringing, but I really do not want to be on poor terms with anyone. Especially you."
    to "So if choosing a different martial art is what I must do, then I will be sure to do it."
    to "But, for now, I will continue to rely on a bodyguard to protect me from this “Yumi” character who appears to have a problem with girls that dress nicely and buy expensive things. "

    scene yasufirstday6

    ay "That was really nice of you, Touka..."
    to "As I said, please don’t make a fuss over it."
    to "If there is anyone in this[school] who I would benefit from creating a deep connection with, it is you."
    to "How unfortunate that our families must compete in the same market. A true Montagues and Capulets situation."

    scene yasufirstday7
    with dissolve

    ay "Come to think of it, I’m not really sure what your family does. "
    ay "You’re really in the same market as mine? Because that’s like...a really weird market."
    to "Oh, yes. It’s an incredibly strange market. "
    to "And while we’ve since expanded to many other markets like hospitality and food service, the one you find yourself in is where our initial fortune comes from."
    to "You see, my grandfather is the original creator of bubble wrap. The poppable kind."
    ay "Woah! Who would have thought Kumon-mi was home to both the family who created bubble wrap and the family who found fortune through innovating it?"
    to "I’m more surprised at just how profitable such a strange venture was for the two of our families. "
    to "But, I suppose it’s best if we choose not to question our wealth and instead attempt to carry on our respective legacies."

    scene yasufirstday8
    with dissolve

    ay "Oh..."
    ay "Yeah, I don’t think I’m really going to be involved in my family’s “legacy” after I get out of [high_school]."
    to "Oh dear. Have your product sales been falling?"
    to "Have consumers figured out how to pop your bubbles?"
    ay "It’s not that. I just don’t really want to follow in my dad’s footsteps. "
    ay "Money kind of turned him into a different person."
    to "Well, is there something else you’d be interested in pursuing instead? "
    to "As I mentioned, the Tsukiokas have their hands in many different aspects of many different markets, and I would gladly put in a good word for you in any of them as I can already tell how kind you are."

    with dissolve

    ay "Thanks, Touka. But I don’t really think something like that is what I want out of life."

    to "Yes, but...after thinking more about it, I just figured you were joking."
    ay "Nope. I’m in love with him and stuff and want to spend the rest of my life by his side."

    "We manage to make it onto the ferris wheel just before the ride is closed up, upsetting a park worker in the process as she was very clearly ready to go home for the day and now has to wait another ten minutes."
    "I’m not too concerned, though. We’ve already upset several other staff members throughout the day due to Tsuneyo’s incessant insistence that her “husband” is coming to pay for her. One more won’t hurt."
    "As the wheel begins to turn and the glowing theme park lights transition from blindingly bright and distorted spheres to tiny balls of multicolored neon, I think again about how surreal this all feels."
    "Just a short while ago, Tsuneyo was doing everything in her power to avoid me — harboring well-deserved, rational resentment for things that I did or didn’t do and now she’s..."
    "Now she’s my wife."
    "Not literally, of course. They don’t offer wedding services here as far as I know, nor would I be able to afford them if they did as Tsuneyo has drained every last bill from my wallet today."
    "But even knowing that every single utterance of the word “husband” was only detached from her tongue for the sole purpose of replacing those words with overpriced food...it felt nice."
    "Different."
    "And all it took to get something like this out of her was a single facial expression and a small dose of venom I must have accidentally spit out after growing tired of her point of view."
    "It’s important to reiterate, however, that I did not grow tired of it because it had gotten stale...or because the monster in question had already been shoved back underneath my bed-"
    "But because I hate being reminded that its decayed and outstretched arms have the chance of poking back out and strangling me whenever they want."
    "One day, I will surely breathe my last. "
    "But for the time being, I will continue to pretend the monster is gone-"
    "And envenomate anyone who reminds me that I’m only saying that."

    t "..."
    s "You doing okay, Tsuneyo?"
    t "I don’t think I’ve ever been this high up before. Are we sure that this is safe?"
    s "If it’s not, at least we’ll die together."
    t "I don’t like the sound of that. I’m not ready to become a tree. "
    s "If you’re that scared, you can close your eyes and wait out the rest of the ride. I’ll tell you when it’s over."
    t "Do not mock me or I will attack you. These hands have dealt the touch of death on many occasions and one more will not cause me any pain at all."
    s "Alright. But when the ride speeds up and our cart detaches, don’t tell me I didn’t warn you."

    scene ferriswheel2
    with dissolve

    t "When {i}what?{/i}"
    s "Yeah. It’s an old theme park tradition. The last ride of every night is supposed to be for thrill-seekers."
    s "All of the cars on the ferris wheel come detached and are put back on in the morning. They’re extremely durable, though. So even if ours comes undone at the very top, we’ll survive. "
    s "Probably."

    scene ferriswheel3
    with dissolve

    t "Probably?!"
    s "Yeah. I’ve never been here before so I can’t really vouch for this park’s safety. But again, at least we’d die together."
    t "How do you remain so calm in the face of imminent danger? Why did you not stop me from going through with this? You are supposed to be a coward as well. You have betrayed me."
    s "Tsuneyo-"

    scene ferriswheel4
    with dissolve

    t "I have not yet said my goodbyes. I must call the Emerald Guardian and-"
    t "Actually, that’s it. I am not particularly close with anyone else."
    s "Calm down."

    scene ferriswheel5
    with dissolve

    t "Do not lure me into {i}un{/i}certain death and then ask me to be calm. You don’t have the right."
    s "I do, because I was kidding. It’s a normal ferris wheel where all of the cars stay attached and there is minimal risk of death."
    t "You are only saying that because you don’t want to be stuck in a small box with someone while they are on the phone. "
    s "No, I’m saying it because I was an asshole and forgot that you have a hard time discerning sarcasm. "
    s "And also, I just wanted to fuck with you because it’s funny."

    scene ferriswheel6
    with dissolve

    t "I am filing for divorce the moment I step outside of this box. I will not allow myself to be abused like this any longer."
    s "We had a good run. "
    t "What a shame it must end with deceit and treachery. I always knew you were not to be trusted. "
    s "Did you have a good time despite that?"

    scene ferriswheel7
    with dissolve

    t "Yes, actually.  It was the most fun I’ve had in a long while. And all I needed to do to feel this way was shirk my one and only responsibility of maintaining Tojo Ramen."
    s "The store will still be there tomorrow. I’m sure you don’t have to worry."

    scene ferriswheel8
    with dissolve

    t "It would be nice if I could believe you."
    s "Yeah, I guess I kind of ruined any chance of being believable for the rest of the night after the whole “imminent danger” thing."
    t "That’s not what I mean. "
    t "I likely would not have returned home regardless of whether or not you showed up today. But your appearance {i}did{/i} help me take my mind off of things...so, thank you for that."
    s "Take your mind off of what, though? Why are you so scared of going home all of a sudden?"
    t "I’m afraid I can’t say. But that’s in no part to me not {i}wanting{/i} to. It’s just a feeling I have."
    t "I told you earlier that the weather felt different...and it feels that way now as well. Like the calm before an unfathomable storm or...being caught in the eye of a hurricane."
    t "Every moment is preceded by an overflowing feeling that disaster is mere moments away, and it is like a voice inside of my head is telling me it will arrive the moment I return home."
    s "Huh..."
    t "And now {i}you{/i} sound worried as well."
    s "It’s kind of hard not to be. The last time a student told me something about having a horrible premonition like that, Yumi beat the shit out of Nodoka and Makoto’s father died."

    scene ferriswheel9
    with dissolve

    t "Her..."
    t "{i}Father...{/i}"
    s "That...no, hold on. I wasn’t insinuating that something horrible is going to happen to your father. I was just saying I can’t really {i}disregard{/i} when people say things like that anymore."
    s "Maybe months ago, I would have thought you were crazy or something. But now, I’m...a little more cautious. "
    s "Skeptical, sure. But I don’t think you’re weird for believing something bad may happen when-"
    t "..."
    s "..."
    t "When what?..."
    s "Don’t worry about it. There’s no point."
    t "Finish your thought..."
    s "..."
    t "..."
    s "When I feel the same exact way."

    scene ferriswheel10
    with dissolve

    t "I see..."
    t "It’s somehow a relief knowing that I’m not as alone as I thought I was in feeling this way. "
    t "I just wish you would have told me sooner so I did not have to go through the entire day feeling so out of place."
    s "I tried...kind of. "
    s "It’s related to something I’ve been trying to talk to you about all day, but you just...kept changing the subject. I was never able to say {i}anything.{/i}"
    s "It’s no fault of your own, though. It’s only natural that you’d do the same thing everyone else does since...that’s what the world {i}wants{/i} you to do or whatever. I have no idea how it works."
    t "Try again now. "
    s "There’s no point. The same thing will happen again, over and over and over because that’s the way things are here. But one day, I have a feeling you’ll-"

    scene ferriswheel11
    with dissolve

    t "You’re misunderstanding something."
    t "I kept changing the subject not because of some predetermined outline or divine intervention, but because I did not want the illusion of this day away from everything to be prematurely dispelled."
    s "What?"
    t "It is abundantly clear that there is something you wish to discuss with me, I just don’t want to hear it until we leave this place."
    t "If I wanted to be reminded of the world outside of this charade of a relationship, I would not have spent the entire day running."
    s "So...wait. Do you remember anything you said on the beach about how everything feels like it’s moving in circles sometimes?"
    t "I do. Just as I remember how you said it actually {i}is.{/i} And then my subsequent comparison of you to my father."
    t "Is {i}that{/i} what you’ve been trying to talk to me about?"
    s "Yes. That’s {i}exactly{/i} what I’ve been trying to talk to you about."
    t "If it was that important, why did you let me walk away the first time you brought it up?"
    s "It...took me by surprise, I guess. No one ever really acknowledges it."
    s "Also, something was brought to my attention very recently that made this all seem significantly more urgent. "
    s "And even though I’m not sure if telling you about it will change anything, myself and several others think it might be worth a try getting you a little more “involved.”"
    t "Involved in what? I don’t understand what you’re trying to tell me."
    s "The world is part of a never-ending cycle and, in order to try and find out {i}more{/i} about that cycle, I need you to sleep at my house so we can do experiments and ultimately save the world one day."
    s "Or at least figure out more about it."
    s "Also, you might see some of your classmates disintegrate or wind up being forced to walk through an empty version of Kumon-mi all by yourself for an undisclosed amount of time."
    s "Are you in?"

    scene ferriswheel12
    with dissolve

    t "Hm."
    s "That’s it? That’s all you have to say in response to my major revelation about how the world is not what it’s disguising itself as?"
    t "Do you mind if I ask a few questions?"
    s "Doing that at my house with everyone else would probably be better and more informative, but I’ll try my best to fill in some blanks now."
    t "How does this relate to what I said about everything feeling different today?"
    s "A cycle is about to end, apparently. {i}I{/i} can’t feel it, but Maya can. Maybe you’re feeling the same thing?"
    t "Maya is involved too?"
    s "And Ayane. And Yumi, but she’s in the same boat as you right now in not being a full-fledged member of the Rooftop Apocalypse Squad."
    t "That’s a good name. "
    s "Ayane made it. It’s subject to change when Maya ultimately vetoes it."
    t "What happens when this cycle ends?"
    s "We start a new one. The school year partially resets along with a portion of everyone’s memories. "
    t "How is it determined which memories stay and which ones go?"
    s "No clue."
    t "How many times has this happened?"
    s "Again, no clue."
    t "How many times have we met? "
    s "Us? Just one."

    scene ferriswheel13
    with dissolve

    t "That’s it? I was under the assumption it would be a lot more."
    s "It probably is. According to Maya, I’ve had my consciousness reset a bunch of times. But for some reason, this version of me is lasting way longer than the others, so now a bunch of weird shit is happening."
    t "I see."
    s "Tsuneyo, I’m glad that you’re cooperating right now, but you’re way calmer about this than you should be."
    t "I’m confused about that myself. I understand how irrational this all is, but I can’t help but feel like it’s not my first time hearing it."
    s "What?"
    t "I mean none of it comes as a surprise to me...but I don’t have any recollection of this either. Everything just automatically makes sense and I can not put my finger on {i}why.{/i}"
    s "Then come to the sleepover. Maya is going to want to hear that and she’d probably have trouble accepting it if it came from me instead of you."
    t "I will. You have my word. "
    t "But can I ask one more thing? It will be the last question as it appears our ride is about to come to an end."
    s "Then I’ll answer as quickly as I can."
    t "If for some reason, my consciousness resets..."
    t "And my memories of this day are not included in the portion I get to keep with me..."
    t "Will you take me here again?"
    s "That’s it? {i}That’s{/i} your final question? Why?"
    t "Because I get it now."
    s "Get {i}what?{/i}"
    t "What the rest of them see in you."
    t "For the first time today, I saw it as well."
    t "I feel like I shouldn’t forget that."
    s "You’d be better off if you did."

    scene ferriswheel14
    with dissolve

    t "I do not want to debate you on whether or not this memory will be beneficial to us."
    t "I just want to know if you’ll let me feel this way again."
    s "..."
    s "Sure."
    s "I’ll take you here as many times as you want."
    s "Just, again...please don’t tell Io."

    t "But you don’t have to accompany me."
    s "Are you sure? We’re miles away from the Old District and I don’t mind taking you back."
    t "There’s no need. It appears the park provides a shuttle to an area near my neighborhood. I wouldn’t ask you to go that far out of your way when I’m capable of doing it on my own."
    s "Then I guess...this is where we part ways."
    t "I will drop the divorce papers off with our family attorney in the morning. Thank you for doing this amicably. "
    s "And thank you for the best day of married life I’ve ever had. I’ll send you a text with the address and time that you need to come over soon."
    t "I don’t need the address. I’ve been to your home before."
    s "Yeah...about that. I have a second one now. It’s a long story. Please don’t tell anyone."

    t "Just how many secret lives are you living? "
    s "Way too many...I don’t know how I do it, to be honest."
    t "Regardless, you’ll be needing my phone number if you intend to contact me."
    s "No need. I got it from Molly earlier."
    t "That seems like an invasion of privacy, but it saves me the effort of repeating it to you, so I will let it slide."
    s "Hey, be mad at her. Not me. I’m not the one dealing out your personal info."
    t "Good. Because if anyone finds out I am divorced, it will make finding another husband all the more difficult. "
    s "I hope you never find one."

    "That’s several times today that Tsuneyo has changed topics without giving me the chance to explain why I came looking for her in the first place."
    "It’s not a good omen for things to come at this point...which is upsetting since I was really beginning to believe that she might be onto something after what she said on the beach."
    "But I guess her connection or...understanding or whatever it is concerning the nature of these cycles is not as strong as Yumi’s."
    "Tsuneyo was never directly affected like she was. She just kind of...accidentally picked up on things? "
    "Maybe that’s not enough to go off of. "
    "Maybe it was just a coincidence that she felt something like that, but-"

    t "One, please. My husband will pay."

    "I have tried on countless occasions to explain to Tsuneyo that those thoughts she had about the repetitiveness of time are not without merit, but she has not heard me even once."
    "And I have given up on trying."
    "I didn’t think I would. And while I’m no stranger to giving up, it’s not as if I approach every obstacle in my path without at least some interest in clearing it."
    "But there comes a time when you need to accept you’re fighting a losing battle...and it’s hard to win any battle at all when you’re not even sure who or what you’re fighting against."

    t "I refuse. Someone made this dish and it is my duty as a fellow warrior to slay it. If you or anyone else had ever left behind something that I took the time to make for you, I would never forget it."

    "I sit at my desk and begin to sort through a large packet of paperwork that was left for me by one of the[school] administrators."
    "I’m not sure why they didn’t just send out an email with all of this information, but I’ve come to accept that nothing about this[school] is normal as-is, so why start changing that now?"
    "Still, though, who would have thought simply transferring a bunch of students from one[school] to another would be such an issue?"
    "Oh, did I forget to mention that?"
    "Right."
    "Following the collapse of the[school] in the more urban section of town, students were given a number of options."
    "The first (And probably the best option) was to simply attend a virtual classroom sort of thing until a new[school] could be constructed."
    "The second option, which a bunch of fucking idiots must have chosen because who would pass up the chance to learn from their bedroom?-"
    "Was the opportunity to transfer[school]s and carry out the rest of their education in none other than [kumon_mi_high]."
    "Also, why is {i}this{/i}[school] the one named [kumon_mi_high] when the other one is also in Kumon-mi as well?"
    "This is stupid."
    "I close the packet and lean back in my chair, waiting for something interesting to happen as I always do."

    s "Do we know each other?"
    q "Not really."
    s "Then why did you come to see me?"
    q "All of the other teachers left for the day and I needed someone to complain to."
    s "Other teachers?"
    s "So you’re a teacher as well?"
    w "Wakana Watabe."
    w "You inherited two of the misfits from my class and I never had the chance to thank you."
    s "Oh, Molly and Tsuneyo’s old teacher. You’re welcome, I guess."
    w "I want to fucking die."
    s "Yeah, you mentioned that when you first walked in."

    with dissolve

    w "Really, though...Why now?"
    w "Things would have been so much easier if everyone just died when that stupid[school] sunk into the ground."
    w "We’re all going to die anyway, no point in sticking around and trying to avoid that."
    s "I want to say that isn’t a very teacher-like thing to say, but I’m in the same boat."

    scene watabesan4
    with dissolve

    w "So you also wake up every morning and struggle to get out of bed and resign yourself to yet another miserable day of misery and...misery?"
    s "More or less, yeah."
    w "Then I shall confide in you from now on as no one else seems to understand me in this god-forsaken[school]."

    w "I want to fucking die."

    "Or she’s just like this all the time."
    "I really have no idea."

    scene watabesan6
    with dissolve

    w "Can I count on you to take all of the weird girls out of my class if we’re really going to be doing this transfer-thing?"

    s "…"
    s "You’re not going to rat me out if I don’t agree to taking on your “miscreants,” are you?"
    w "Oh, not at all. Do you have any idea how long and arduous that process would be?"
    w "Even showing up to[school] takes more energy than I’m willing to expend."
    w "So it’s fine if you continue being a horrible excuse for a teacher. I’m not going to do anything about it."
    s "Well...Thanks then, Ms. Watabe."
    w "Wakana, please."

    w "She’s one of the only good students I know."
    w "I even tried to poach her for my class but she vehemently refused, electing to keep fixing {i}your{/i} mistakes instead."
    s "You tried to steal one of my students without even telling me?"
    w "Just the one. To make up for it, you can have anyone from my class that you like."
    s "Twelve is already way too much for me."
    w "Pathetic. I have thirty and I’m about to get even more."
    s "Jesus. How big is your classroom?"
    w "Too fucking big. Get me out of this hell, please."

    scene watabesan12

    s "Thanks, Makoto. You really helped clear my name for me."

    scene watabesan15
    with dissolve

    w "Hah..."
    w "Not like it really matters to me..."
    w "No point in putting any effort into anything when we’re all just going to get sucked into the void when we least expect it."
    s "Does that mean you’ll be coming back to complain to me more often from now on?"

    scene watabesan16
    with dissolve

    w "Agreeing would imply that I put actual thought into my actions."
    s "Is that...not a thing you normally do?"
    w "It’s not."

    w "Right."
    w "See? You’re starting to get it."
    mak "As...much as I’d hate to interrupt...whatever is happening right now, I {i}do{/i} need to start going over the transfer process with you, Sensei."
    mak "It’s a little different this time given the amount of girls who will be moving into the[school]."
    s "Maybe Ms. Watabe can stay around to hear your explanation as well? I know she’s struggling too."
    w "I’m not struggling with this, I just hate it."
    w "I finally had some time to breathe with Molly leaving and now I have to deal with even more transfer students. What if they’re worse?"
    s "Just so you’re aware, the transfers are coming from Kumon-mi, not Dublin."
    mak "I don't think Molly's country of origin has any bearing on her-"
    w "I don’t care {i}where{/i} they’re coming from. I just want them to shut up and do their fucking work."

    scene watabesan17
    with dissolve

    w "Oh. Sorry again, Miyamura."
    w "You shouldn’t have to hear that."
    mak "It’s fine...I even feel like I learned a thing or two about you today, Ms. Watabe."
    w "Does this mean you’ll leave this man and come keep my class in-line instead of his?"
    s "At least be considerate enough to not do this in front of me. Poach her behind my back."

    scene watabesan18
    with dissolve

    scene watabesan21

    s "How do you even gauge everyone’s level when I’ve stopped assigning work?"
    mak "Keeping track of everyone’s level is the mark of a good teacher. I {i}need{/i} to pay attention to things like this or I’ll never make it anywhere in life."

    mak "Well anyway, Uta should be showing up sometime over the next few days along with the first “batch” of new girls."
    mak "There are quite a few of them given that their former[school] was rather large, so most classes will see sizable increases in the near future."
    mak "We’ll only be receiving Uta with the first wave, though."
    s "Really? The[school] is getting that many new girls and we’re only getting one?"

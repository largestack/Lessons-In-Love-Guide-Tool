    r "..."
    o "So...are you gonna start? Or should I? "
    r "You start. Talking about serious stuff is hard and awkward and I feel like I’ve been doing it with literally everyone lately."
    r "Plus, I’ve apparently already got another talk lined up for later tonight and I feel like I’m going to be the one to have to get that one started."
    o "On the bright side...at least you’re getting pizza?"
    r "Yeah. That’s pretty much the only thing keeping me hanging on at this point, Otoha."

    o "Hah..."
    o "Being in a relationship is a lot of fucking work, isn’t it?"
    r "Yeah. But that’s exactly why I-"
    o "Shut up. You literally just told me to start and I’ve barely even said anything yet."
    r "My bad. The nerves are kicking in. "
    o "There shouldn’t be any nerves at this point, Rin. "
    r "There will always be nerves. I’m a nervous person. Especially around people as pretty and talented as you."

    scene otoharinoutside3
    with dissolve

    o "Think buttering me up will make me go any easier on you?"
    r "Think? No. Hope? Yes."
    o "Well, it won't."

    scene otoharinoutside4
    with dissolve

    o "Thankfully...I’m not mad. So there’s not really anything to “go easy” about."
    o "I’m just...confused. Your parents breaking up is such a huge...important thing to hide from me. And I thought I made it plenty clear in the past that I don’t want you keeping those things to yourself."
    r "You have. But you also made it clear that you want things to be easy and fun and-"
    o "Shut up. I’m still not done."
    r "Okay. But you might be better off just bringing a roll of duct tape with you whenever you leave the house from now on because I’m extremely bad at keeping quiet and might require some assistance. "

    scene otoharinoutside5
    with dissolve

    o "I didn’t realize you were into that sort of thing."
    r "I am into literally anything you want to do to me whenever you are ready to actually do things to me. Which might be never at this rate because I suck at this."
    o "You wanna know what you really suck at? Understanding me. "

    scene otoharinoutside6
    with dissolve

    r "Yeah...Yeah, that’s hard. "
    r "It’s not just you, either. I’m kind of like that with everyone."
    r "If I don’t see or hear something firsthand and just have to figure out whatever the issue is on my own, I’m basically screwed. Which is one of the big reasons I didn’t tell you about my parents."
    r "Everything happened so quickly and I panicked because I’ve been making them out to be the paragon of all things lesbian and if {i}they{/i} couldn’t last-"
    o "You didn’t think we would either."
    r "It’s more like I didn’t think {i}you{/i} would think we would last."
    o "I have no idea if we will or not. But it’s not like I’m in any rush to find out. I like taking things slow, remember?"
    r "It’s hard not to. And if that sounded insulting, it wasn’t supposed to be. We’re just really different people on the inside. "

    scene otoharinoutside7
    with dissolve

    r "Kind of ironic how the hardest part of dating a girl so far has been also just, you know, {i}being{/i} a girl."
    o "As much as I want to tell you you’re looking at it all wrong and that has nothing to do with how, uhh...bumpy things have been so far, I can’t. You’re exactly right."
    o "That’s on me, though. I’ve got like, zero exposure to this sort of thing and all I really know is that I like you and don’t mind having your tongue in my mouth a few times a day."
    o "But where you’re wrong is thinking whatever happens between your parents has anything to do with {i}us.{/i}"
    o "It’s not like hearing about them splitting up is going to make me think, “Oh. I guess all lesbians are doomed now. How sad.”"

    scene otoharinoutside8
    with dissolve

    r "See! Then this is just one more example of me not understanding something I’m supposed to understand because that’s exactly what I thought you’d think!"
    o "I might be inexperienced, but I’m not a fucking idiot."

    scene otoharinoutside9
    with dissolve

    r "Well, I am and I apologize. "
    r "It’s no secret that things are still a little weird with us and I just wanted to keep them as minimally weird as possible."
    r "But unfortunately, I am going to be further complicating our relationship by now being the only daughter of a fractured household who must go on an epic journey to pick up all of its pieces."
    o "I think you should maybe...leave the epic journey to the two of them. I doubt there’s much you can do to fix whatever problems may have led to this."
    r "I can’t fix {i}their{/i} relationship. I can’t fix {i}ours.{/i} What good even am I?"
    o "Do you actually think we need “fixing?”"

    scene otoharinoutside10
    with dissolve

    r "Do you?"
    o "Nah. Just a little...tuning."
    r "Music analogy. Because we’re in the light music club. And we play music. You’re so cool."
    o "That better not be sarcasm."
    r "It’s not. I really do think you’re the coolest person, like...ever. And I’m sorry that I have once again burdened your greatness by accidentally exposing it to the downfall of my parents."
    o "Oh, please. The downfall of your parents is the least of my worries when it comes to our relationship right now."

    scene otoharinoutside11
    with dissolve

    o "Wait, no. Forget I said that. That came out wrong."
    r "..."
    o "I...didn’t mean to make it sound like I’m worrying about something. I’m good. "
    r "It’s okay, Otoha. You can say it."
    r "Chances are I already know what it is anyway."

    scene otoharinoutside12
    with dissolve

    o "Then..."
    o "If you already know what it is...how come you haven’t said anything about it?"
    r "Because you’re wrong."

    scene otoharinoutside13
    with dissolve

    o "..."
    r "..."
    o "..."
    r "This is technically a new conversation, so I’m going to start this time if that’s okay with you."
    o "Good. Because I have no idea how I’d do it without sounding like a complete bitch."
    r "Can I start by asking you for a favor?"
    o "A little unorthodox for the beginning to a serious talk, but sure."
    r "Have more faith in me."
    r "There’s a big difference between keeping things from you because I’m an idiot who can’t figure out how you’ll react and literally just straight up cheating on you with a girl who doesn’t even like me."
    o "If she did like you, though...would that change anything?"
    r "No. Right now, you’re the only girl I have my eyes on. And it’ll stay that way for as long as we’re together."

    scene otoharinoutside14
    with dissolve

    o "Why...Why’d you even let her into the club in the first place? She doesn’t even play music."
    o "And you were so excited about it too. It’s almost like you {i}wanted{/i} her to join."
    r "Because I did."

    scene otoharinoutside15
    with dissolve

    o "You what?"
    r "I did want her to join. And I’m happy she’s a part of the club."
    o "But-"
    r "She’s my friend, Otoha. A friend I’ve had for years. So what if I had a crush on her for most of those? She turned me down and I’m with you now."
    r "I’m not going to just remove her from my life because of a thing that happened that never even went anywhere."
    o "Rin, don’t take this the wrong way...but you’re not exactly well known for always thinking things through."

    scene otoharinoutside16
    with dissolve

    r "That’s kind of hard to {i}not{/i} take the wrong way when it makes it sound like you don’t trust me."
    o "..."
    r "Is that what you’re saying?"
    o "I don’t know what I’m saying. I just...I see the way you look at her and I can’t help but get worried."
    r "Worried about what? That I’m just waiting for Chika to realize she was wrong and that she {i}does{/i} actually want to date me after all?"
    o "See, this is why I didn’t want to talk about it. I know how it sounds. But even if we’re dating now, we still barely even know each other."
    o "Why {i}wouldn’t{/i} you choose Chika over me if she actually {i}did{/i} change her mind about you?"

    scene otoharinoutside17
    with dissolve

    r "Ohhhhh...so that’s how it is."
    o "What?"
    r "It’s less that you don’t trust me...and more that you’re just jealous."
    r "You think Chika has something you don’t...and that I’m only dating {i}you{/i} because things didn’t work out with her."

    scene otoharinoutside18
    with dissolve

    o "That’s not...no. There’s still a lot of context you’re ignoring. Or...missing. Or something."
    r "Is there? Should I go back to being apprehensive? Or should I stay playful and fun so this conversation doesn’t take a turn for the worse?"

    scene otoharinoutside19
    with dissolve

    o "Huh?"
    r "Hearing you’re jealous makes me happy. It means you don’t want to lose me. Which is good, because I was half convinced you were kind of indifferent about that at this point."
    o "Of course not."
    r "So, what part are you {i}most{/i} jealous about? The fact that she has several years of a head start on you? Or the fact that she was the first girl I fell in love with?"

    scene otoharinoutside20
    with dissolve

    o "The {i}first{/i} girl you...fell in love with?"
    r "Should I...not have said the L word? Because I know it’s weird to use it when nothing ever happened, but I still think my feelings at the time were strong enough for me to-"
    o "No, no...I mean..."
    o "Wouldn’t saying {i}first{/i} imply that...I’m the second?"
    r "..."
    o "..."

    scene otoharinoutside21
    with dissolve

    r "...Noooooo?"
    o "Oh. Okay, yeah. Yeah, because now is still way too soon to start throwing big, serious words like that around."
    r "Yuuuuuuup."
    o "And, like...we’re still too young to really even understand what “love” is anyway. Right?"
    r "Yuuuuuu- "

    scene otoharinoutside22
    with dissolve

    r "Wait, no."
    o "No?"
    r "Yeah."
    o "...Yeah?"
    r "Yeah as in no. Like...I don’t agree with the thing you just said."
    r "What does it even mean when people say you can’t fall in love until you’re an adult? That makes literally zero sense."
    r "Do our feelings not count until we reach a certain age? At what point have we lived long enough to fall in love?"
    o "Uhh...I’m just...you know...repeating what I’ve heard before..."
    o "Did you...really feel that strongly about Chika, though?"

    scene otoharinoutside23
    with dissolve

    r "Uhhhh..."
    r "Will you get jealous again if I say yes?"
    o "Nuh-uh. Because that would imply that I want you to love me and...it would be, like...totally way too early for that sort of thing. You know?"
    r "..."
    o "..."
    o "Rin?"
    r "I did feel that way about her."
    r "I would have done anything."

    scene otoharinoutside24
    with dissolve

    r "But getting my heart broken was a good thing...because it wound up leading me to you."
    r "If I had never fallen in love with Chika, you and I never would have met. We wouldn’t be here right now trying to work out our problems."
    r "We wouldn’t be anything."
    r "You don’t have to be jealous...or worry...or anything like that, Otoha. I’ll be just as loyal to you as you are to me. I promise."
    r "Besides, Chika’s already sleeping with Sensei anyway, so she’d never even hook up with me in the-"

    scene otoharinoutside25
    with dissolve

    r "Mm!"
    o "Chika is {i}what?{/i}"

    scene otoharinoutside26

    r "Nothing! I...I have no idea why I..."
    o "That was a joke, right? Like...there’s no way those two are actually..."

    scene otoharinoutside27
    with dissolve

    r "I never said that, okay? Erase the last thirty seconds from your memory. I have no idea how I even..."
    r "Neither of them can know, okay? They’re both really important to me and I don’t want anything happening that might change the way they-"
    o "Yeah...Yeah, okay. Yeah, I won’t say anything. Yeah."
    o "Should, like..."
    o "Should we...{i}tell{/i} someone, though?"
    r "Tell them what? What are you talking about?"
    o "That...our teacher is sleeping with a-"
    r "He’s not! {i}They’re{/i} not! Just..."

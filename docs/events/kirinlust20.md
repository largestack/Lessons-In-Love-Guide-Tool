    "Kirin doesn’t say anything."
    "I guess she’s waiting for me to take the reins, but...it’s kind of weird seeing her as the one on her backfoot when she’s usually so aggressive. "
    "On a normal day, I can imagine her coaxing on Nodoka with even more fervor than I’d be able to muster-"
    "But now, she’s more like a self-lubricating, unclothed mannequin being pulled along by a semi-vitriolic retail store manager."

    no "No, Mr. Humbert. I can not."
    s "Kirin, I want you to know that I’m not saying these things because I am more interested in Nodoka, but because I am also feeling slightly strange about her casualness here."

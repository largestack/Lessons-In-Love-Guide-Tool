    "I’m wandering the halls of the[school] during lunchtime, trying to figure out what I want to do today."
    "I realized just a few minutes ago that I’d forgotten my wallet at home, and considering that this[school] is pure evil and does not offer free lunch to the staff-"
    "I am left with no other option but to either starve or mooch off of my students."
    "The thing is, the cafeteria isn’t exactly a prime mooching spot since other staff members are in there, so I have to figure out a way around that."
    "…"
    "I am suddenly overcome by a strong urge to try my luck on the rooftop."
    "I don’t know much about anime, but one of the few things I do remember is that important characters always seem to be on the roof for some reason."
    "I just hope that the door is unlocked since I still lack a key..."

    "I step out into the air only to be immediately assaulted by a level of humidity that makes this seem less like a roof and more like a sauna."
    "At least the door was unlocked, though."
    "I’m not really sure why, but I will gladly accept this convenient chain of events and chalk it up to a gift from God."
    "Now, to find someone who can give me food."

    scene makotoroof1
    with dissolve

    "A diligent girl wraps her fingers around the chainlink before her, staring out at a city she isn’t allowed to leave."
    "But despite the inability to ever go somewhere bigger, at least at this point in time, she understands this town has everything others could offer and more."
    "And so she stands here, in this place of quiet contemplation that others would view as a refuge, and wonders-"
    "Why try so hard if I can never escape?"

    s "Makoto."

    scene makotoroof2
    with dissolve

    mak "Ah, what?! Sensei?! "
    mak "What are you doing up here?"
    s "Give me food."

    scene makotoroof3
    with dissolve

    mak "I beg your pardon?"
    s "You’re breaking at least fifteen different[school] rules by being on the roof during lunch. I will accept food in exchange for my silence."
    mak "I am not...and I don’t even have any food."
    s "If you don’t have any food, what’s your explanation for being on the roof right now?"
    s "This place is reserved for delinquents and rendezvous between [young]anime-couples."

    scene makotoroof4
    with dissolve

    mak "Just so you’re aware, the student council has access to the roof as well."
    mak "Yes, it may be for the sole purpose of monitoring whether or not other students are spending time up here, but that is beside the point!"
    mak "What are {i}you{/i} doing here, Sensei? I believe that is a much better question."
    s "Is it really, though? I feel like someone like me is more prone to visiting places like this than your archetype."

    scene makotoroof5
    with dissolve

    mak "Well...that may be true. But even someone like me feels the need to escape every now and then."
    s "Well...if you’re ever looking for even more of an escape, I wouldn’t mind helping you-"

    scene makotoroof8
    with dissolve

    mak "Don’t you dare even think about saying what you’re about to say, Sensei."
    mak "I will climb over this fence right now."
    s "Oh, right. I forgot that escape rooms make you claustrophobic. My mistake."

    "I take a moment to look at the fence."
    "There’s no way she can climb that high."

    s "That’s a big fence, Makoto. Do you think you’re physically capable of scaling it?"
    mak "I’m not sure, but I swear on Einstein’s grave that I will find out if you continue to push me."
    s "…"
    s "Okay, fine. I’m sorry."

    s "Just to get back to that escape thing, though, is it really necessary for you to come to a place like the[school] roof?"
    s "Couldn’t you just hang out in the library or something?"

    scene makotoroof1
    with dissolve

    "Makoto takes a moment to look back over the horizon and sighs to herself."
    "It’s not a heavy sigh or anything like that. If anything, it’s more like the sound someone makes when they’re giving up on something."

    mak "I guess I could. The library is certainly more fitting for someone like me, isn’t it?"
    mak "After all, what could I possibly gain from coming somewhere like this?"
    mak "I’m not an artist or a writer or anything like that. There’s no ‘inspiration’ that I can leech from a pretty view. "
    mak "It’s just a different view of the same things I see when I’m walking down the street each day."
    mak "Nothing more, nothing less..."
    s "…"

    stop music fadeout 15.0

    mak "Why are you here, though, Sensei? "
    s "Didn’t I already tell you? I’m looking for food."
    mak "And so...you came to the roof? I’m not quite following your reasoning."
    s "Well I forgot my wallet at home and just felt strangely compelled to come here for some reason instead."
    mak "Compelled by what?"
    s "Uh..."
    s "Hunger?"
    mak "Hmm..."
    mak "While it’s true that extreme hunger can often lead to irrational behavior, I can’t imagine that simply going a day without lunch would drive you to that point."
    mak "Perhaps it was something else that brought you here?"
    mak "Maybe a hidden urge to throw yourself from the top of a building?"
    s "…"
    s "Excuse me?"
    mak "Hm?"
    mak "Did I say something strange?"
    mak "It’s not uncommon for people to have thoughts like that. It’s not as if it’s revealing your true intentions or anything of the sort."
    mak "But then again, Japan has one of the highest suicide rates in the entire world, so the likelihood of you following through would be marginally higher in some respects."

    "I’m..."
    "What?"
    "What the fuck is she talking about?"

    s "Sorry for asking this all of a sudden but, are you okay?"

    scene makotoroof10
    with dissolve

    mak "Of course. Why do you ask?"
    s "It’s not like you to randomly go off on depressing tangents like this."
    mak "Is it truly depressing if it’s based on logic and reason rather than emotion?"
    mak "I’m simply giving you the breakdown of my thought process. I didn’t intend to evoke any darker feelings."
    s "I mean...I guess if you say so..."

    scene makotoroof11
    with dissolve
    play music "sweetvermouth.mp3"

    mak "Apologies if any of that made you feel weird, though. I’ll try to be a bit more candid in the future."
    s "No need to apologize, just felt compelled to ask if you were doing alright after hearing that. That’s all."
    mak "Well then, yes. I’m totally fine. And thank you for caring enough to ask."
    mak "It’s strange, though. It seems as if you’ve felt compelled to do several things today."
    mak "First the roof, now this...Perhaps I should be the one checking on {i}you{/i} instead?"

    scene makotoroof12
    with dissolve

    mak "Your mind hasn’t been taken over by someone else, has it? Hahaha~"

    "…"

    s "Of course not. I don’t think things like that are even possible."

    scene makotoroof11
    with dissolve

    mak "Neither do I, of course. I was just trying to make a joke after dragging the mood down so much."
    mak "Besides, if something like that {i}were{/i} possible, I’m sure I’d be the first to notice."
    mak "You and I spend so much time together that there’s no way something as big as that could just slip by me."

    "I...wouldn’t be so sure of that if I were you, Makoto."
    "In fact, it seems like the first person to notice was actually the one I’m {i}least{/i} close with. How’s that for irony?"

    scene makotoroof13
    with dissolve

    mak "Sorry in advance for getting sappy, but I wonder where I would be right now if the two of us never met?"
    mak "Sure, we’ve barely known each other for a year, but it feels like much longer."
    mak "I’ve learned so much from you, even if you’ve sort of given up on the whole teaching thing."
    s "Hey, I haven’t given up. I’m just trying out new methods."
    mak "Well, whatever you’re doing, it seems to be working."
    mak "Everyone’s grades are up and the last set of standardized tests were lifelong highs for almost everyone involved."

    scene makotoroof14
    with dissolve

    mak "I’m going to take some of the credit for that if you don’t mind, though. I’ve been doing my fair share as well."
    s "Hell, you can take all of the credit if you want. Like you said, I barely even do anything."
    s "I’m kind of just moral support at this point while all of you figure out how to do stuff on your own."
    mak "Hahah~ Well moral support is always important too, Sensei."
    mak "Plus, there are always other things you can do to help us other than just explaining chemistry and things of the sort."
    s "That’s great. This might be a shocker to you, but chemistry is definitely not one of my strong points."
    mak "Oh? And what {i}are{/i} your strong points, Sensei?"
    s "…"

    if bonus == True:
        s "Sex education."

    "And so the two of us head back downstairs. "
    "Makoto locks the door behind us, ensuring that I won't be able to come up here again without getting a key from either her or Yumi."
    "Of course, she’s blissfully unaware that Yumi even {i}has{/i} a key at the moment, so I just need to make sure she doesn’t find out if I ever want to come up here again..."

    s "Dying..."
    s "Need...water..."

    "Hey there."
    "If you couldn’t tell, it’s excruciatingly hot today."
    "So much so that halfway through wandering around Kumon-mi looking for something to do, I’m already prepared to call it quits. "
    "Seriously, though, what gives?"
    "You’d think after resetting the world, Maya would have at least made it so the temperature isn’t threatening to melt my insides every day."
    "She mentioned being able to change things but...maybe something like the weather is out of her control?"
    "Who even knows? Maybe she just likes the heat."
    "..."
    "I come to a stop in front of a corner-store in the residential area next to the one Ami and I live in."
    "I don’t typically come over to this part of town, likely due to the fact that there isn’t really anything here- but I figured I might as well try something different today."
    "Plus, this also seems like a great chance to run into a side character."
    "I wonder which one it will be this time?"

    "Oh, look. It’s Kaori."
    "And she’s scowling at a pizza."
    "That seems about right."

    k "Tch-!"
    k "This hot, circular cheese-and-tomato wheel is causing me anguish."
    k "I have only eaten one out of eight triangles and I am already in pain."
    k "Am I...allergic to shapes? Is that what is happening?"
    s "Hey, Kaori. Having some trouble there?"

    scene pizzakaori2
    with dissolve

    k "Hamburger Man?! What are you doing here?!"
    k "And why are you without a [young_girl]?!"
    s "I’m not...always with a [young_girl], Kaori."

    else:
        s "And when I am, it's only to help them prepare for the workforce after exiting college."

    k "I was beginning to think you were part of a...umm...what’s the word-"
    k "Human trafficking ring?"
    s "Human trafficking? Is that really the line of work you think I’m in?"
    k "Yes. None of the girls who have appeared beside you were ever seen again."
    k "How much money does a human female go for, Hamburger Man?"
    s "I’m a teacher, Kaori. That explains why I’m always with [younger_girls]."

    if bonus == True:
        "Well, actually...it kind of doesn’t. But I doubt someone like her would understand that."

    scene pizzakaori4
    with dissolve

    k "…"
    k "I smell deceit."
    s "Deception doesn’t have a scent, Kaori. It’s probably just the pizza."

    scene pizzakaori5
    with dissolve

    k "Yes! Pizza! {i}That{/i} is the proper name for the cheese wheel! Thank you, Hamburger Man!"
    k "I am now slightly closer to believing you are an actual teacher!"

    "I take a seat at the table opposite Kaori and put my elbows down on it, resting my chin in my hands."

    scene pizzakaori6
    with dissolve

    k "Why are you sitting with me?"
    k "I did not give you permission to sit here."
    k "If you have come for the human-pizza, I am not willing to share."
    s "Okay well, first off, please don’t call it a human pizza. That makes it sound like something completely different."
    k "Heard."
    s "Secondly, I’m not going to take anything from you unless you offer it."
    k "You aren’t?"
    s "Correct."

    scene pizzakaori7
    with dissolve

    k "Hm..."

    "A look of distrust spreads across Kaori’s face as she attempts to decipher human conversation and the connotations that come along with it."

    k "I have a hard time following your reasoning, Hamburger Man."
    k "You always seem to want food whenever I see you, and this time, you suddenly do not."
    s "Of course I always want food when I see you. You work in like nine different restaurants."

    scene pizzakaori8
    with dissolve

    k "Is that not normal? "
    s "Of course it’s not normal. Most people only work in like one or two at a time."
    k "But then...what do they do with all of their free time?"
    s "Uhh...I don’t know. Don’t you have any hobbies?"
    k "…"
    s "…"
    k "I am unfamiliar with this word. “Hobby.”"
    k "What does that mean? It sounds fake. Is that a fake word?"

            k "I was unaware people could view those photos and have since deleted the account!"
            k "My underwear is now safely stored in the private confines of my own logical telephone!"
            s "Smartphone, Kaori. Smartphone. "
            k "Logical telephone!"
            s "Also, why do you need those pictures anyway?"
            k "That does not matter! Please progress the conversation to the next stage! My face feels hotter than normal!"
        else:

        scene pizzakaori7

        with dissolve

        k "Furry things!"
        s "I’m sorry?"
        k "Furry things! Soft things! The ones that make cute noises like “woof” or “purr!”"
        s "So, you like animals?"
        k "Yes! Are animals a hobby?"
        s "Well, uhh, animals {i}themselves{/i} aren’t a hobby...but I guess stuff related to animals can be? "
        k "Then yes! This is what Kaori likes!"

    s "Well, either way, I think you should try spending less time at work and more time doing fun stuff."
    s "Life gets boring pretty quickly if all you do is work."

    scene pizzakaori8
    with dissolve

    k "Are you also a hard worker, Hamburger Man?"
    s "I’m..."

    "Well..."
    "I show up every day."
    "Does that count?"

    s "I guess you could say that."
    k "I am impressed. I didn’t realize human trafficking required so much effort."
    s "Again, I’m a teacher. Not a human trafficker."
    k "Apologies. You are the first “teacher” I have come into contact with in many years. My knowledge of them is wearing out."
    s "Many years? How old are you, Kaori?"
    k "I am roughly 154 in dog-years."
    s "Human years, please."
    k "Apologies. I am 22 in human-years."

    if bonus == True:

    else:
        s "Why aren't you in college, then? I understand that you are already working, but there could be so much more out there for you."

    k "What is a “college?”"
    s "It’s like high school but for adults."
    k "I see."
    k "What is a “high school?”"
    s "It’s-"
    s "Wait, you didn’t go to high school?"
    k "Would that be something I remembered if I did?"
    s "Uhh, yeah. Kind of."
    k "I see."
    k "Then no."
    k "No high school."
    s "Then...what the hell were you doing during your teenage years?"
    k "…"
    k "I think I went to the “movies” once."
    s "…"

    "I swear, this girl gets even more confusing every time I talk to her."

    s "So, let me get this straight-"
    s "You didn’t go to high school..."
    k "Correct."

        s "You didn’t go to college..."
    else:
        s "You aren't going to college..."

    k "Correct."
    s "But you did go to the movies once."
    k "I think so, yes."
    s "How are you landing all of these jobs? "

    scene pizzakaori10
    with dissolve

    k "Restaurants do not require formal education and typically accept any help they can get."
    k "So I have done nothing but that for as long as I can remember."
    s "Well, I’ll concede that you’re a pretty good waitress but-"

    scene pizzakaori4
    with dissolve

    k "I am the {i}best{/i} waitress."
    s "Right, you are the {i}best{/i} waitress, but...I just can’t imagine life being all that exciting if you don’t do anything other than that."

    scene pizzakaori10
    with dissolve

    k "Do you have a suggestion for things to do instead? You seem to know a lot about human life."
    s "Yeah, most humans do."
    s "How about this, though-"
    s "What if I took you around and kind of just, showed you stuff every once in a while?"
    k "You would be my human-life coach?"
    s "I mean, it would probably be easier to call me your friend, but sure."
    k "How much does this service cost, Hamburger Man?"
    s "It’s...free?"

    scene pizzakaori2
    with dissolve

    k "You will teach me the proper way to live for no money at all?! Human traff- {i}teachers{/i} must make a lot of money!"

    "We really don’t, unfortunately..."

    s "Well, there is one thing you can give me..."

    scene pizzakaori11
    with dissolve

    k "Ah-"

    "Kaori pauses for a moment and...starts to blush?"

    s "…"
    k "…"

    scene pizzakaori11
    with dissolve

    k "I have not done it before but-"
    s "I was just going to ask for your phone number..."
    k "…"
    s "…"

    scene pizzakaori13

    k "My face feels very hot all of a sudden."
    k "I will give you my phone number if you can make it stop."
    s "I..."
    s "Sure, yeah. Whatever."

    "Kaori writes her phone number down on a slip of receipt paper and hands it to me."

    k "I still feel the heat."
    s "It’ll go away soon. "
    k "How soon?"
    s "Soon."
    k "How soon?"
    s "Kaori, chill."

    "She immediately takes off down the alleyway to catch it."
    "Sensing that she won’t be coming back any time soon, I wind up asking for a box to take the rest of the pizza home."
    "I hope we have room in the fridge for this..."

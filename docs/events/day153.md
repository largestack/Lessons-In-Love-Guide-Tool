    "A couple of us are helping Molly move into her new dorm room today."
    "Tsuneyo wound up getting permission from her father to spend some nights here, so the two of them are going to be the first pair to move into the second floor of the dorms."
    "Well, at least the second floor allotted to my students."
    "Apparently, I inherited the “misfit” class."

    if bonus == True:
        "Not because they’re actually misfits themselves, but because nearly every other girl in their grade is housed in the building directly next to this one."

    else:
        "I feel just like Hillary Swank in the 2007 film Freedom Writers."

    s "Celebrate."

    a "Yeah...well, you’re stupid. I say we rescue the bird."
    s "How? You can’t even reach it."
    a "No, but you can. "

    s "Oh hey, Maya. I must have forgotten you were there since I haven’t been insulted in over two minutes."

    scene thebird6

    s "If you’re tired then why are you here? Shouldn’t you go downstairs and take a nap or something?"
    m "It’s too late in the day to nap. I’d just fall asleep for the entire night."

    scene thebird7
    with dissolve

    m "Besides...Molly is {i}technically{/i} a friend of mine and it would be rude for me to not assist given the circumstances."
    s "What circumstances?"

    scene thebird6
    with dissolve

    scene thebird4

    a "Give it a rest already. We get it."
    s "I don’t hate Maya at all."
    m "He’s right. I’m the one who hates him. Please keep him away from me."

    scene thebird8
    with dissolve

    a "Ugh. Whatever, I’ll just figure out how to save it on my own. "
    a "Go help Rin with boxes or something, Sensei."
    s "Oh, right. We’re supposed to be moving things."

    scene thebird9
    with dissolve

    r "Kill me..."
    s "Hey, Rin. What’s the problem?"
    r "So many boxes. So little strength."
    s "Here, let me take a few those from you. I have a strange amount of experience when it comes to carrying boxes out of the dorm."

    scene thebird10
    with dissolve

    mo "No can do, Master! There is a strict no-boys-allowed policy when it comes to my personal belongings."
    mo "Ignoring that would cause your hands to turn black and fall off!"
    s "Then why am I even here?"
    mo "Because you’re the protagonist! This is a scripted event that must occur if I’m ever to become the lead heroine!"

    scene thebird11
    with dissolve

    r "Wait, you’re shooting for the lead? The chuuni character never gets the lead role. You should know this."

    scene thebird12
    with dissolve

    mo "That’s not true. Rikka got the lead in the Chuunibyou series."
    r "That one literally has Chuunibyou in the title. That doesn't count."
    s "What the fuck are you two even talking about?"

    scene thebird13
    with dissolve

    mo "Oh, sorry! Time for another weebnote!"
    s "Awesome. I’m sure all of our imaginary fans will love this."
    mo "Chuunibyou is the term given to the behavior of characters who act in overdramatic and often embarrassing ways!"
    s "You mean like how you act literally every day?"
    mo "Exactly like that! It’s what makes me lovable and you will come to appreciate it in due time, Sir."
    s "Come to think of it, didn’t you say something in class about how Rin was like...the commander of the undead or something?"
    s "Does she have this chuunibyou thing, too?"

    scene thebird14
    with dissolve

    r "N-N-Not as bad as Molly has it! I'm just a normal dork who does dorky things! It's not bad enough to label it with an actual condition!"
    mo "You have fallen just as far into the darkness as I have and you know it."

    scene thebird16
    with dissolve

    r "I have not! And stop bringing up my secret life when we’re not in the club room anymore! I’m begging you!"
    mo "Everywhere is a club room when you are unable to exhibit self-control."

    scene thebird17
    with dissolve

    mo "But I guess there {i}are{/i} more pressing matters at hand right now. Right, Captain?"
    s "Captain. Master. Sensei. Sir. Can you just pick one already, Molly?"
    s "I have too many names now and it’s confusing me."
    mo "Sir yes, Sir. You will henceforth be known as Supreme Overlord Sensei, Herald of the Adolescents."

    "That’s somehow even worse than having four names."

    s "Molly, come to think of it, how come you’re making Rin carry all of your stuff?"
    s "We came all the way here to help {i}you{/i} out, but I don’t think I’ve seen you actually do anything so far."
    mo "I can assure you that there is a perfectly acceptable reason for that."
    s "Okay...And what’s the reason?"

    scene thebird18
    with dissolve

    mo "You see...I expelled the majority of my power during a fight with an ancient wizard earlier today and am now only able to use 5%% of my total strength."
    s "You said your reason was acceptable. I’ve been deceived."

    scene thebird19
    with dissolve

    mo "Okay, fine. I am very weak, Sir."
    mo "My fragile Irish arms can’t even carry a sack o’ potatoes up the stairs."
    r "Why would you ever need to do that?..."
    s "I thought the Irish were supposed to be tough? You know...that whole {i}fightin’ Irish{/i} stereotype and whatnot."

    scene thebird20
    with dissolve

    mo "Sir, this may come as a shock to you, but I don’t go outside all that much."
    s "That doesn't come as a shock at all, actually."
    mo "The result of my inability to exercise has, for lack of a better term- turned my muscles into mashed potatoes."
    s "Are you really going to make potato references every chance you get? "
    mo "Probably, Supreme Overlord. That is simply the person I am."

    scene thebird22
    with dissolve

    r "Oh, speaking of potatoes, do you still want to come bathing suit shopping with Futaba and me tomorrow?"
    mo "What does that have to do with potatoes?"
    r "Nothing. I just need to know because I was supposed to respond to Futaba like half an hour ago."
    mo "Oh, umm...yeah. I can come, I guess. "
    s "Are you not looking forward to the beach, Molly? That’s not really the excited sort of reaction I’d expect out of someone like you."

    scene thebird24
    with dissolve

    mo "To be quite frank, Sir, I am utterly horrified. I’m not even sure if I’m going to survive this trip."
    s "That seems a little extreme."

    scene thebird25
    with dissolve

    r "For the record, Molly...it would probably be best to, like...{i}not{/i} ask Sensei things like that."

    "At least Rin understands me."

    mo "Tell me, Supreme Overlord. Is this the body of someone who looks like she would fare well under the intense Kumon-mi sun?"
    mo "I will be a lobster in less than five minutes."
    mo "I don’t even know how to swim. "
    s "Then what the hell are you going to do at the beach?"

    scene thebird26
    with dissolve

    mo "Make memories that only girls my age are able to make! Live life to the fullest! Find the man who killed my father and avenge him!"
    r "Your dad is still alive, though..."
    s "That seems like a lot to do in one weekend."
    mo "Thankfully, the backup plan is reading manga under an umbrella."
    s "That sounds a lot more realistic."
    s "But if you’re looking for something a little more...beach-oriented, I could always teach you how to swim."

    scene thebird27
    with dissolve

    mo "I...will respectfully decline! I am perfectly happy not knowing how to swim!"
    r "How are you that red already, Molly?..."
    mo "Irish skin! It reveals our true emotions even when we don’t want it to!"
    r "Are you really that embarrassed thinking about Sensei teaching you how to swim?"
    mo "Of course! That’s like, straight out of a dating-sim. I’m not yet prepared."
    r "You know you're never going to be the lead heroine with that attitude, right?"
    mo "…"
    r "…"
    mo "I need to go set more things up in my room!"

    "Molly quickly vanishes into her dorm and I’m left in the hall with Rin and the others."

    s "She is certainly a character."
    r "That’s an understatement. Molly lives in a world of her own."
    r "You'd think that with all the raunchy manga and h-games she plays that she'd be able to talk about touching another human without getting flushed, but...nope."
    r "She straight up can't even talk about romance without getting like that either. It's wild."
    s "Speaking of romance, are you excited to see Chika in a swimsuit?"

    scene thebird29
    with dissolve

    r "I’m going to actually die."
    r "Do you have the hospital on speed dial? Because if not, you should definitely get on that."
    s "Sure. Just for you, though. If anyone else asks me to call an ambulance, they’ll be shit out of luck."
    r "That’s kind of a horrible thing to say."
    s "I’m kind of a horrible person."

    scene thebird30
    with dissolve

    r "The best horrible person."

    "Rin holds out her fist to me, expecting a fist bump. "
    "Instead of immediately reciprocating, which is what my heart tells me to do, I am faced with a troubling question."

    if bonus == True:
        s "If I pound it right now, does that doom me to a life in the friend-zone?"
        r "Are you implying you’re not already in the friend-zone?"
        s "I sure hope not. "
        r "Flirting with me is a bold move when you know for a fact that I am undressing Chika with my mind right now."
        s "Are you doing anything else at literally any point in your daily life?"
        r "Only if another cute girl walks by. But then I default back to Chika the second they're gone."
        s "Yeah, I guess that makes sense."
        r "Finish the fist bump, Sensei. These boxes are heavier than they look and you are leaving me hanging."
    else:
        s "If I pound it right now, will it activate some sort of secret device somewhere that will cause all of us to either die or grow really tall?"
        r "Idunno. Beats me."

    "I decide to swing by the porn shop to see how Maki’s doing, but the smile on her face tells me all I need to know- which means that I am now going to focus on Osako instead."
    "I don’t know how these opportunities to embarrass her keep falling into my lap, but I’m glad they are considering that the chances of {i}her{/i} ever falling into my lap are essentially zero."
    "If I can’t have her, I can at least make her question her existence on this planet- a common strategy employed by many others like me...Albeit with typically less consistent and successful track records."
    "I sigh to myself as my win rate ticks down from 100%% and take my place behind her which, again, is a thing I will never be able to do in the way I want."
    "She’s a lesbian- just in case you aren’t quite picking up what I’m putting down here."

    maki "See this baby right here? This is the DildoSaber- fresh out of the factory and ready to pierce through the heart (Or vagina) of the one you love."
    maki "And if blue isn’t your color, never fear! This thing has a grand total of {i}seven{/i} color settings. And if what I’ve heard is correct, the glow is so bright you can even see it {i}inside{/i} of your partner if the lights are off!"
    os "Is that even safe?"
    maki "It wouldn’t be on the market if it wasn’t. "
    maki "Plus, if for some reason its handleability isn’t already a strong enough selling point, it also has several vibration settings you can access from the official DildoSaber app. "
    os "Wow...They’re really starting to get creative with stuff like this, aren’t they?"
    os "I don’t know. It seems fun...but I’m not really sure if it fits our style. We’re not really {i}app{/i} people."
    os "Do you have anything more, uhh...you know-"

    scene osakopornshop2
    with dissolve

    maki "Dark and somber? "
    maki "Something that would strike fear into the heart of anyone {i}unready{/i} for the games you lovebirds play? "
    os "Hahah...so you...remember..."
    maki "I never forget a customer, Osako Osaka. "
    os "I don’t really know how I feel about that."
    maki "Besides, if I had a dollar for every time I’ve had to pretend to not recognize your partner at school meetings, I’d have enough to afford...maybe a tenth of an official DildoSaber."
    os "Either that thing is damn expensive or you’ve only seen Wakana a handful of times outside of this building."

    scene osakopornshop1
    with dissolve

    maki "It happens every now and then. But with how-"

    scene osakopornshop3
    with dissolve

    maki "Oh! I’m sorry. I was so absorbed in the official DildoSaber that I didn’t even see you there. "
    maki "I’ll be with you right after I finish with this customer."

    scene osakopornshop4
    with dissolve

    os "No, it’s totally fine. She can go ahead of-"
    s "..."

    scene osakopornshop5
    with dissolve

    os "Oh, fuck."
    s "Hey, Osako. Crazy meeting you here."
    maki "Acquainted already?"

    scene osakopornshop6
    with dissolve

    os "I have never seen this man before."
    s "She’s lying. We’re actually best friends. She even shares her girlfriend with me sometimes."
    os "This store wouldn’t happen to be hiring a security guard would it? I feel suddenly compelled to kick the shit out of the nearest pervert."
    s "Run, Maki. Run while you still can. "
    maki "I’m not worried. You see, the official DildoSaber is so heavy-duty that you can also use it as a weapon if you’re ever in a pinch!"
    maki "And with its collapsible...dildo part, it makes the perfect sex toy {i}and{/i} self-defense weapon! Perfect for stuffing into both your bag {i}and{/i} your partner!"
    s "Osako, I’m no lesbian, but this DildoSaber sounds pretty intense and I think you’d be a fool not to buy it."

    scene osakopornshop7
    with hpunch

    os "I don’t want the fucking DildoSaber!"
    maki "Ah-"
    s "Now look what you’ve done. You’ve hurt Maki’s feelings."
    maki "You can make it up to me by purchasing the official DildoSaber for the low, low price of-"

    scene osakopornshop8
    with hpunch

    os "Mm!"
    maki "Wait. I suddenly remembered I have to...go over there!"
    maki "Please {i}come{/i} find me when you’re ready to check out."

    scene osakopornshop9
    with dissolve

    "Sensing that her life must be in danger, Maki scurries off- retreating into the back room and, if her dialogue tonight has been any indication of where her personal interests lie, probably testing out the DildoSaber."

    os "Is nothing sacred anymore? "
    s "If you were seeking sanctuary in this house of unholiness, I have very bad news for you."

    scene osakopornshop10
    with dissolve

    os "Why are you even here? "
    s "The same reason you’re here. Because I’m a sex positive adult looking for a good time."
    s "Also, I’m friends with Maki and wanted to check in on her."
    os "Then check in on her instead of talking to me. I didn’t ask for this."
    s "Right now, I think some alone time with that new toy is what Maki needs most."

    scene osakopornshop11
    with dissolve

    os "I think she needs a lot more than that based on what I’ve heard from Wakana about her husband. "
    s "You’re right. We should go cheer her up physically. But I get to go first."

    scene osakopornshop12
    with dissolve

    os "That seemed low and insensitive even by your standards."
    s "I tend to let it all hang loose in here. That’s what Maki would want after all."

    scene osakopornshop13
    with dissolve

    os "Yeah...I’ve been avoiding coming here lately for that exact reason. I thought she’d need more time to grieve, but...it looks to me like she’s at least somewhat okay now. "
    os "I guess she could always be acting, though."
    s "Having to {i}avoid{/i} this place makes it sound as if you might have some sort of addiction, new best friend."

    scene osakopornshop14
    with dissolve

    os "Stop calling me that. And also, stop trying to probe me for information about my sex life. I’m not going to tell you anything."
    s "If you’re not going to tell me anything, can I at least ask you an extremely generalized, lesbian-based question that I've always been curious about?"
    os "Is it going to be sexist, insensitive, or the result of blatant obliviousness?"
    s "I just want to know why lesbians still like penis shaped toys but not actual men."
    os "So yes. It is going to be all three of the things I just said."
    s "You can not blame man for his curiosity."
    s "You are free to not have sex with him, though."

    scene osakopornshop15
    with dissolve

    os "Well, thanks so much for your {i}permission.{/i} I really-"
    s "Makoto."

    scene osakopornshop16
    with dissolve

    mak "In the flesh."
    s "What are you doing down here? I didn’t think you were ready to-"
    mak "I’m getting a drink. We’re out of bottled water upstairs."
    mak "Also, please stop pestering the customers. If you’re looking for a quick release, check the aisle in the back left. New TENGAs, 30%% off. Woohoo."
    maki "Makoto! Makoto!"

    scene osakopornshop17
    with dissolve

    maki "Look! They came! Heh. Came. And they’re even cooler than I thought!"
    mak "Can you stop waving that thing around? You look like a maniac."
    maki "But it’s got an accelerometer in it that gives it that cool {i}whoosh{/i} noise like you hear in the movies!"
    mak "You know what? Maybe I’ll just die of thirst. "
    maki "Noooo, come on! Pick one up! We’ll have an official DildoSaber fight!"
    s "So, Osako- would you rather stay here and listen to this? Or come talk to me outside about this secret addiction of yours?"

    scene osakopornshop18
    with dissolve

    os "It’s not an {i}addiction.{/i} I just..."
    s "Just what?"
    os "Just don’t want to talk to {i}you{/i} about it. It makes me uncomfortable."
    s "What difference is talking to me about something like this than someone like Maki? As the owner of a penis, I probably know just as much as she does."
    s "If anything, I feel like it should be easier to talk to me since you have literally zero sexual attraction toward me and have likely fantasized {i}at least{/i} once about the owner of this porn shop."

    scene osakopornshop19
    with dissolve

    maki "Everyone does, Osako. I’ve accepted it. It’s nothing to be ashamed about."
    mak "Yeah, that’s it. I’m gonna go die now."

    scene osakopornshop20
    with dissolve

    maki "Wait! No! I’ve already lost one!"

    scene osakopornshop21
    with dissolve

    maki "Makoto! Come back! I’ll give you a discount on your first official DildoSaber!"
    mak "I don’t want a DildoSaber! I want you to pick up more water from the grocery store! The tap water tastes weird!"
    os "Hah..."
    os "I guess...you’re kind of right about the whole sexual attraction thing. I just don’t want you getting weird about this when it seems like “getting weird” is all you’re really good for."
    s "That might be {i}something{/i} I’m good for, sure. But I know when to stop. Kind of. "
    s "And if you heard my inner monologue, you’d know that I’ve already acknowledged the fact that we’re never going to bang like three or four times tonight alone."
    os "Three or four? Isn’t that a little too often?"
    s "Probably, but it’s far less than it would be for everyone else. "
    s "If you don’t want to talk, that’s totally cool and I am happy to just embarrass and annoy you for the rest of the night."
    s "I just figured there might be something you want to get off your chest if you’ve been literally and intentionally {i}avoiding{/i} this place."
    os "Even if there is, what would you do? What sort of relevant sex advice am I going to get from a heterosexual male?"
    s "Hey, we both like women, don’t we? We might have more in common than you think."

    scene osakopornshop22
    with dissolve

    os "..."
    s "..."
    os "Can you promise to not repeat any of this to Wakana?"
    s "Sure."
    os "And to not be a fucking perverted creep about it if I actually tell you anything?"
    s "That one sounds harder but, again, sure."
    os "And no more sexist, insensitive, blatantly oblivious questions?"
    s "I will literally just stand there if I have to. Like Maki, I really just want you to find what you’re looking for."
    s "I doubt I can find it for you but, at the very least, I can walk by your side so you seem less suspicious and don’t feel pressured to just walk away empty-handed."
    os "..."
    s "..."
    os "God, I hate having no one else to talk to sometimes. "
    os "Fine. Come on. But I’m breaking your arm the second you get weird."

    with dissolve2

    "Osako and I step outside to avoid the constant pressure to buy a certain sci-fi themed sex toy that even {i}I{/i} was relatively impressed by and press our backs against the wall."
    "It’s quiet enough around here that we {i}should{/i} be keeping our voices down, but the lack of any noticeable person outside means we may not {i}have{/i} to."
    "I guess that’s up to Osako, though. It’s not as if I’m about to come clean about {i}my{/i} sex life to her when confirming anything at all could prove to be...problematic, if nothing else."
    "She has her suspicions, of course. She’s seen the way I am with Ayane. "
    "But I think it would be a whole new story if..."
    "No."
    "This is supposed to be about her."
    "Not me."

    os "So..."
    os "Telling you any of this is just as much of an invasion of Wakana’s privacy as it is mine, so I really {i}will{/i} kill you if any of it gets out."
    s "I don’t want to die any time soon, so knowing that gives me one more reason to keep my lips sealed."
    os "So, uhh...Wakana and I..."
    os "Well...we’ve got a...certain dynamic when it comes to sex."
    os "One that {i}I{/i} love, mind you...that I don’t really have any issues with at all."
    os "But I always feel like I’m not...doing enough for her. Which makes me feel like I...I don’t know, {i}can’t{/i} do enough for her."
    os "And any time I try to...take the initiative and change the way things work, she just pulls out an Uno reverse card on me and, before I know it, {i}she’s{/i} winning again."
    os "Or I guess...{i}losing,{/i} by most people’s standards...But why would someone always want to {i}lose{/i} when {i}winning{/i} feels so much better?"
    s "I know a metaphor when I hear one."
    os "I just want her to {i}win{/i} sometimes too, you know? It feels...unfair. But she’s never shown any sign of wanting that dynamic to change or being unsatisfied and..."
    os "I don’t know, man. You know I’ve got some...dependence issues...and confidence issues...and other shit like that. It’s probably just those things going to work again."
    os "I just can’t help but feel like I’m doing something wrong...Can’t help but feel like I’ve gotta try and shake things up in some way."

    scene osakopornshop24
    with dissolve

    s "Lucky for you, a brand new product just hit the shelves that's sure to light up even the darkest of sex lives."
    os "Don’t you fucking turn on me, man. I swear."
    s "I figured a joke might be better than any obsolete, heterosexual advice I might have."

    scene osakopornshop25
    with dissolve

    os "Just give me normal advice. Human to human. Tell me I’m overthinking this and...manufacturing problems when none really exist."
    s "Have-"
    os "And before you go asking me if I’ve talked to Wakana about it, I have. But she insisted it’s no issue at all."
    s "Then it’s no issue at all."
    os "You really believe that?"
    s "Doesn’t matter what I believe. What matters is that you trust her and she’s already told you how it is."
    s "If she’s lying, you’ve got much bigger problems on your hands than which one of you cums more frequently."

    scene osakopornshop26
    with dissolve

    os "Okay. Guess my metaphor is dead."
    s "I came out here to listen tonight- not to speak in riddles and pretend to understand what you’re going through."
    s "If you’ve got some issues with your sex life, even if those issues {i}aren’t{/i} issues according to the person you {i}think{/i} has issues...the only person you can work it out with is them."
    s "And again, not a lesbian, but I’m pretty sure there isn’t a single sex toy out there that is going to just magically quell all of the worries you’re burdened with at the moment."
    os "Nothing other than the official DildoSaber, you mean."

    scene osakopornshop27
    with dissolve

    s "You know, the fact that you decided to talk to me at all instead of just outright purchasing something we already know to be a solution is really bizarre."
    os "Believe it or not, there’s a limit to how much torture I can endure. And that seemed a little too large for my tastes."
    os "Not really the shape I like either. I prefer them more...{i}authentic.{/i}"
    s "Is my question from earlier really that insensitive? Because I seriously don’t understand how the lesbian brain works and why penises are suddenly cool once they’re not attached to a man anymore."
    os "That’s the forbidden question, dude. Asking it is never going to get you the answer you’re looking for."
    os "Fact is, even if I’m not physically attracted to men, they’ve got an appendage that gets the job done. I’m sure there as just as many gay dudes with onaholes tucked away in their nightstands. "

    scene osakopornshop28
    with dissolve

    s "If it feels good...it feels good, I guess."
    s "I doubt there’s a limit to the amount of torture you can endure, though. If there is anything I have learned through our brief time together, it’s that you are submissive as all hell."
    s "Or, as Imani put it at the bar recently, you “radiate bottom energy.”"
    os "Takes one to know one. I’ll be damned if she doesn’t radiate that same energy right back."
    s "What kind of energy do I have?"

    scene osakopornshop29
    with dissolve

    os "You?"
    os "Negative."
    s "That’s it. We’re not friends anymore."

    maki "Ah! There you guys are."
    maki "What’s going on out here? Thinking of going halfsies on an official DildoSaber? Act now and I’ll throw in a full set of anal beads for no cost at all."
    s "Is that more up your alley, Osako?"
    os "Only if Wakana wants it to be."
    s "Imani was right. Even {i}I{/i} can feel the bottom energy and I have only known about its existence for a few days."
    maki "Energies aside, I think I found something you might actually be interested in, Osako. But it’d probably be best if I showed you {i}alone.{/i} Without Sensei."
    s "What crazy lesbian toy am I not allowed to know the existence of?"
    os "You coming onto me, Maki?"
    maki "You? When I’ve got a box full of DildoSabers? The Bugatti of sex toys? Don’t make me laugh."

    os "Alright, alright. Let’s see what you’ve got."
    s "Am I really not allowed to see this?"
    maki "Sensei, if you saw this, it would change everything you know about women. It’s best to leave this to us."
    s "What does that even mean?"
    os "It means it’s time for {i}you{/i} to take your little victory and head home. Can’t believe I’ve been actually opening up to you lately. The Hell is going on with me?"
    s "Y-"
    os "And don’t say I’m falling in love with you. You were surprisingly bearable tonight, which is weird given the place we ran into one another."
    os "{i}Wouldn’t want to ruin it now.{/i}"

    "Osako and Maki head back inside to take a look at...whatever sort of device would forever change my opinion about women."
    "I have no idea what that means, so I’m just going to assume it’s actually a mech and that they are planning to take over the world."
    "And while that might not be true, it’s an option that will prevent me from jerking off to the fantasy of sleeping with her {i}regardless{/i} of her preferences."

    "Well, normal apart from the fact that Makoto is sleeping, Maya and Chika are absent, Molly and Tsuneyo disappeared out of nowhere, and Yumi is skipping."
    "Actually, that last part is normal. But Maya is typically here and Chika’s stopped skipping altogether ever since I “gave up” on teaching. "
    "It’s crazy how not assigning any[school]work can motivate students as much as this."
    "More teachers should give up on teaching and just let [teenager]s be [teenager]s."

    s "How long have you two been there?"
    mo "Since the first bell tolled, of course!"
    mo "The Kendo Princess jumped into my shroud of concealment and we were able to sneak behind you without so much a hint of being detected."

    t "Would you like to hold hands as well?"

    scene makotoistired11

    scene makotoistired14

    t "Even though you really haven’t taught us this year, either."
    s "Yes, I got that."
    s "I didn’t know you two talked to the principal, though. Makoto should have told me about something like that."

    scene makotoistired15
    with dissolve

    mo "Well, we did! And boy do I have some great news to share with you!"
    s "Wait, were you really approved to be in my class again next year?"

    "Not like it matters if this cycle is just going to repeat again soon anyway."
    "But I’m glad these two cared enough to go to the effort of actually doing something about their troubles rather than just sitting back and accepting them."
    "That’s actually kind of admirable- especially for these two misfits."

    mo "Oh, heck no. We weren’t approved at all."
    s "Oh."
    s "Well then what’s the good news?"
    t "The good news is that we weren’t not-approved either."
    s "So it was basically just a maybe?"
    mo "Correct. But maybe doesn’t mean no!"
    mo "So if the stars align, there is a chance you have not seen the last of Molly MacCormack, Sir!"
    mo "In fact, there is no way you have seen the last of Molly MacCormack! This is still her introductory arc!"

    mo "Right-o, Tsuney-o. If you wind up losing Virginia before me, though, I’m throwing down Damnation."
    t "That sounds scary."
    mo "Very scary. It destroys all creatures. They can’t be regenerated either."
    t "I don’t know much about regeneration, but I am almost positive that I am a creature."
    s "Is Virginia really the term we’re using now?"

    scene makotoistired17
    with dissolve

    mo "Oh-ho-ho~ Have you caught on to what Virginia means, Sir?"
    mo "A typical visual novel protagonist wouldn’t connect all of those dots for at least another twenty hours."
    s "Yeah, I think I’ve made it pretty apparent that I’m not exactly “typical” so far."
    mo "That just means there’s more of a chance for me to succeed. Especially without the presence of a childhood-friend heroine."
    t "Molly says my archetype is “The one without a real shot.”"
    t "It sounded offensive when I heard it but I don’t know what this “shot” is in regard to anyway, so I should not be upset just yet."
    s "Good luck, Tsuneyo. "
    s "You definitely do have a shot, though."

    scene makotoistired18
    with dissolve

    t "I do?"
    mo "She does?!"
    s "Of course. What kind of protagonist would I be to rule anyone out without giving them a chance?"
    t "I want to rejoice, but I still don’t understand what the {i}shot{/i} is."

    scene makotoistired19

    t "Are we enemies now?"
    mo "Not yet. But the inevitable turn has begun."
    mo "The clock has started to tick and, whether you like it or not, all shall come tumbling down eventually, Kendo Princess."

    if bonus == True:

    scene makotoistired21
    with dissolve

    mo "Do not follow me, Kendo Princess! All of my defensive abilities are on cooldown!"
    t "I must follow you. No one else ever talks to me."
    mo "That’s because you’re weird and only talk about noodles!"
    t "Loving noodles is not a crime. Do you need me to pat your head again?"
    mo "Leave me alone!"

    "Huh..."
    "I hope the fact that two of them talked to the principal doesn’t get me in trouble."
    "I can’t imagine that conversation went well or...even understandable for that matter."

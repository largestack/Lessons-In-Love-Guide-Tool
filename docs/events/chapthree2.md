    "All of the bad things in all of the world are not unfortunate coincidences nor byproducts of the timelines we find ourselves in."
    "They are the divine retribution of comedic false gods who only exist during times in which we’re forced to call upon them to solve problems we simply can not."
    "But those calls are met with laughter. "
    "And that laughter not only pierces the innermost sections of our ears but drills holes into our skulls so wide and so malformed that we can’t help but focus on them for far longer than we should."
    "Focusing makes it harder."
    "Not just to live and breathe and walk...but to think and hear and see. "
    "If it were not for these comedies and the entertainment of anthropomorphized xoana who take on life only when looked at, things would be far too simple."
    "Gods can not exist if there is no one there to scorn them, just as I can not exist if there is no one here to scorn me."
    "And to think that just moments ago I seriously contemplated praying."
    "To who?"
    "Another wooden idol inside another glass case somewhere- staring back at me with hollow sockets where its eyes should be? Immortalized by a small plaque and more locks than necessary to guard a piece of wood?"
    "We could not capture gods, so we created our own."
    "We gave them stories and names and, in turn, lives."
    "But once those lives became too powerful they took everything from us, and now I can’t even walk a block down the fucking street without subconsciously damning them for their poor sense of humor."
    "This was not meant to happen."
    "I should be the one still lost."
    "Ayane and Maya should be the ones embracing on top of the school rooftop...and me?"
    "I should be locked in a box."
    "I should be locked in a box and only taken out to be glanced over and mocked, rather than being the one who holds the key to unlock all of the boxes in-"
    "In..."
    "That’s right..."
    "Boxes..."

    ay "So...is there anywhere you think we should go first?"
    ay "I figured the shrine might be a good idea. It would probably be best to check the places Maya regularly visits before doing anything else."
    s "I think..."
    s "I think we should go back to the dorms."

    scene memories2
    with dissolve

    ay "The dorms?...But I already told you I checked there. No one was left in any of the rooms."
    s "It’s just a...feeling I have."
    s "Even if we don’t find Maya, I think there might be something that could give us some sort of hint."
    ay "A hint? Like...a note or something?"
    s "Or something."
    s "If she’s not there, we can check the shrine. I’m just feeling a little too pissed off at the gods right now to grace them with my presence."

    scene memories3
    with dissolve

    ay "We’ll find her...don’t worry. Getting mad at the gods probably isn’t going to do us any favors right now."
    ay "I don’t blame you for feeling that way, though. Even I’m a little mad right now, and I barely ever get angry."
    s "Well, you should. Anger is good for you. Kind of."
    s "Just don’t get angry at me. "

    scene memories4
    with dissolve

    ay "I don’t know, Sensei...In fact, if there’s anyone I should have a reason to be mad at right now, it’s you."
    ay "Here we are, {i}basically dating,{/i} and I find out you’re in love with one of my best friends. That seems like a good reason to get angry, doesn’t it?"
    s "I’m not {i}in love{/i} with anyone, Ayane..."

    scene memories5
    with dissolve

    ay "Not even me?..."
    s "That’s..."
    s "I didn’t mean it like that."
    ay "Hm..."

    scene memories6
    with dissolve

    ay "Do you want to know what I think, Sensei?"
    s "Sure. It would be nice to learn a little more about you during our last days on earth."
    ay "I think the problem is that you just don’t understand love."
    s "Well...you’re not wrong about-"
    ay "I’m not done."
    ay "What I was going to say next is that not understanding love doesn’t mean you don’t {i}feel{/i} it. "
    ay "I know for a fact you love me. And Ami. And Maya. And probably a bunch of other girls too."
    ay "And while I’d definitely prefer a monogamous relationship, I’m not going to fault you for the things you feel, even {i}if{/i} you can’t put those feelings into words."
    ay "Especially because I also think that, one day...you’ll figure that part out."
    ay "And that all of those things you tell yourself about how you’re not meant to love or be loved will sound flat out silly."
    ay "I don’t know if I’ll be the one with you {i}when{/i} you figure it out...or if it will be someone like Maya instead..."
    ay "But I hope you’ll get to accept and understand what it means to be in love one day."

    scene memories7
    with dissolve

    ay "Because it really is the greatest feeling in the world."

    "Despite still not understanding the rationale, Ayane doesn’t put up a fight when it comes to heading over to the dorms- especially since it will finally give her an opportunity to change out of her pajamas."
    "And while I don’t expect to find Maya there given that the place has already been searched {i}once,{/i} having some sort of...starting point might help in locating her."
    "And if there are any of those mystery boxes left in her room, I’ll finally be able to open one up without facing any immediate consequences."
    "It’s just unfortunate that it took her disappearance and the slow realization that I might not ever see {i}her{/i} again for me to be able to do that."
    "........."
    "......"
    "..."
    "Memories are silly, the way they come and go."
    "And nostalgia’s like a blanket of softest, whitest snow."
    "But winter’s dead, the snow is gone, and all that’s left is woe."
    "So if my memories are next to die, you can say I told you so."

    ay "So...what is it we’re looking for again? A...note or something?"
    s "Anything."
    s "Maya keeps a bunch of sketchy boxes near the foot of her bed that I think might have some sort of...hint or something in them."
    s "At least that’s the only logical conclusion I can draw at the moment pertaining to why she always has me carry them to the school in the middle of the night."

    scene memories9
    with dissolve

    ay "She does...what?"
    ay "Also, we were just at the school. Why didn’t you look while we were there?"
    s "Easy. I didn’t think of it until we were already halfway here."

    ay "Sensei, I love you, but for both of our sakes, I really hope you get better at this whole “end of the world” thing."

    ay "You’re a pessimist, I know. "
    ay "But even if there is 0.01%% chance of this working, I think we have to try."
    ay "And I think that, if we don’t, we’ll wind up regretting it for the rest of our lives..."

    "I guess...there’s not really any {i}harm{/i} in going out and looking for Maya. Especially since she’d just wind up waiting for me after getting here anyway."
    "But, like Ayane said, Kumon-mi is a huge city...and if Maya is constantly moving around, she could theoretically stay lost forever. "
    "With that in mind, wouldn’t it be best to just wait {i}here?{/i}"

    "My stomach twists itself in knots as I do my best to fight off what I believe at first to be a wave of nausea, but discern moments later as just a sinking feeling in my gut."
    "A feeling telling me to go along with Ayane’s idea despite its flaws and the fact that it could very well backfire and cause both of us to lose ourselves forever."
    "A feeling that I should be discarding in favor of {i}her{/i} safety so that I can ensure at least {i}she{/i} does not have to repeat a life that brought her nothing but pain and perpetual longing."
    "But a feeling that I {i}can’t{/i} discard because it is impossible for me to prioritize the feelings of others over my own."
    "It’s only fitting that my organs would start twisting the moment I come to terms with the possibility of acting selfless."
    "And it’s only fitting that I would risk it all once more in an attempt to move one step closer to the embrace of someone who should only be admired from afar."
    "The idea of Maya living on in my memories without retaining her own makes me sick."
    "But what makes me even sicker is knowing that she’s been stifling that nausea this whole time."
    "And that each and every warning she gave me must have only made it worse. "
    "Before making my decision, a familiar thought crosses my mind."
    "Why does everything have to hurt so much?"

    "On our way down the stairs and into the street, I bite off a large chunk of my nail."
    "A great deal of my skin comes off along with it."
    "And while I roll it across my teeth and press against the sharpest bit of it with my tongue, I am reminded once more of why everything has to hurt so much."
    "It is not because we want it to."
    "It is because we deserve it."

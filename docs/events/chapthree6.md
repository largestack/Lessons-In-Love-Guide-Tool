    "I walked to school with the same girls I always walk to school with (Ami included again this time) and, for the most part, it was like nothing ever changed."
    "Well, nothing apart from Ayane’s newfound hobby of poking Maya’s buttons every chance she gets."
    "It’s all in good fun, though."
    "And to be frank, we kind of need it."
    "We almost lost someone the other night."
    "And no, I’m not just saying that because it’s Maya. I’d feel the same way about {i}anyone{/i} in the class if they came to school the next day without any memories."
    "Which I guess says a lot about how much everyone cared about {i}me{/i} in the beginning since...I went through that exact scenario."

    w "You look about the same."
    s "Handsome and mysterious?"

    w "Where’s your sidekick?"
    s "Which one? I have like ten now."
    w "Imani. I wanted to invite her to the bar with Osako and me tonight. "
    s "Wait, really? I kind of figured she annoyed you based on the totally not racist “No Imani” sign she told me about yesterday."

    scene newsummerstuff4
    with dissolve

    w "Oh. Wow. Yeah, I...really didn’t even think of that. "
    w "That’s not how she interpreted it, is it?"
    s "I don’t think so. But still, why ban her from your room if you’re just going to go out looking for her instead of letting her come to you?"

    scene newsummerstuff5
    with dissolve

    w "Because I know she is on the hunt for her own office and I refuse to give away the only location in this building that I can be comfortable in."
    s "So you sacrifice me instead?"
    w "Is that not what friends are for? Sacrificing?"

    "Today, I learned one more reason why Wakana doesn’t have many friends."

    s "No, Wakana. I don’t believe that’s what friends are for. But if I see her, I’ll tell her you’re looking for her."

    scene newsummerstuff3

    w "Thanks. We don’t really know many people around our age. Not to mention ones who actually seem to have a mostly good head on their shoulders. "

    w "Who knows? Perhaps I think the testosterone would ruin the atmosphere? "
    w "Besides, you’re older than us to begin with, aren’t you?"
    s "Am I?"
    w "I kind of just assumed that based on your demeanor and how fed up you are with life."
    s "If we judged people based on that alone, you’d likely be dead and buried right now."

    scene newsummerstuff6
    with dissolve

    w "Ah...and how wonderful that would be."
    s "I thought you weren’t allowed to say things like that anymore after the incident?"
    w "Are you referring to the one where you left me for dead and didn’t even stop by to say hello?"
    s "Are we really not past that yet?"
    w "Imani never left me for dead, Arakawa."
    s "Imani wasn’t even employed here yet."
    w "Are you? Because I often find myself believing you’re some sort of homeless person who just wandered in that no one has bothered removing yet."
    s "Okay, I’m going to go to class now. "
    w "Look at you, doing your best to play the role of a teacher. How cute."
    s "Anyway, if that’s all-"

    scene newsummerstuff7
    with dissolve

    w "Wait."
    s "What now? I already told you I’d tell Imani about your estrogen filled bar night."
    w "This has nothing to do with estrogen."
    s "I have no idea if that’s a good thing or a bad thing."
    w "I was just wondering if you had any sort of interest in archery."
    s "That’s...a weird thing to wonder. And to plan on asking me about."
    w "It {i}would{/i} be...if I was not the advisor for the school’s archery club."
    s "Am I being recruited right now?"
    w "Not necessarily. But I can’t exactly move the way I used to. So if you’re able to look after the club on occasion when I’m unable to, I’d greatly appreciate it."
    s "Are you really sure I’m older than you? Because between that and those permanent bags beneath your eyes, I’m beginning to have my doubts."
    w "If you’re {i}not{/i} interested, could you at least do me one other favor? "
    s "Does it involve estrogen?"
    w "It...actually does."
    s "Sure, Wakana. I’ll fuck your girlfriend. "

    scene newsummerstuff8

    w "Oh please. You wouldn’t know the first thing about what she likes."
    s "Vaginas and handcuffs."
    w "You wouldn’t know the third or fourth things about what she likes."
    s "I can figure them out."
    w "{i}Arakawa.{/i}"
    s "Fine. What do you {i}actually{/i} want?"
    w "I want you to keep my role as the archery club advisor to yourself...because if a certain brown-haired genius found out about it and joined the club, I would be forced to resign."
    s "Nodoka is {i}still{/i} bothering you?"
    w "That girl will chase me off the end of the sidewalk and into the abyss below."
    s "Then sure. I'll keep your secret safe."
    w "Thank-"
    s "Under one condition."
    w "I will not allow you to bed my woman, Arakawa."

    w "Misery takes its toll on the body rather viciously. "
    s "You’re only one year younger than my famous idol ex-girlfriend, Niki Nakayama. "
    w "Right. Your famous idol ex-girlfriend. I’ll be sure to tell my astronaut uncle and his panhandling capuchin monkey all about her."
    s "I’m not joking. I really did-"
    w "Goodbye, Arakawa."

    scene newsummerstuff1

    w "Oh, and if Miyamura is looking for a club to join, be sure to send her my way. A handful of your girls have already applied, so she wouldn’t be without friends."

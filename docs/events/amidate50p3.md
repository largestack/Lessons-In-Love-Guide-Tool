    play music "lifeismostlygood.mp3"

    "The portion of the day we spend in the entertainment district is mostly negligible, so I guess I can find solace in the fact that Ami isn’t suddenly lying to me about {i}everything.{/i}"
    "I can also find solace in the fact that she has offered to pay for me despite me telling her multiple times that it isn’t necessary."
    "But hey, who am I to refuse free food when it’s so kindly offered up?"
    "I’ve humored her enough to wind up beside her at some random cafe. Turning down an act of kindness now would make it appear like I have no desire to be here at all."
    "And, you know what? Now that the sad portion of the day is over, I really don’t hate this."
    "It’s nice being able to focus on what’s directly in front of me without needing to wrap my mind around any obnoxious subtext or deflect all of the horrible things I’ve done as they’re thrown back at my face."

    a "So...I guess you and Molly made up?"

    "At least I had a decent thirty minutes or so."

    s "Forget what happened between Molly and {i}me.{/i} For a second back there, I thought you two were going to run away together."

    scene amidatecafe2
    with dissolve

    a "Huh? What gave you that idea?"
    s "Probably the part where your faces were touching and you were gazing into each other’s eyes."

    scene amidatecafe3
    with dissolve

    a "Were you even listening to that conversation?! It was really sad! We were just having a cute bonding moment!"
    s "It would have been cuter if you two kissed."
    a "You...don’t mean that! And stop deflecting! I still need to know what happened between you two since you never tell me anything anymore!"

    scene amidatecafe4
    with dissolve

    s "You know I don’t {i}have{/i} to tell you everything, right?"
    a "Yeah, but I tell {i}you{/i} everything so it only seems fair if you maybe tell me {i}some{/i} things every once in a while."
    s "Nah. I'm good."

    scene amidatecafe5
    with dissolve

    a "Fine. I’ll just ask {i}her{/i} then since we’re making plans to hang out soon. {i}She’ll{/i} tell me."
    s "Just leave it alone, Ami. Please."

    scene amidatecafe6
    with dissolve

    a "Please? But you never say please. Is it really that serious? Because you made it sound kinda unimportant the last time I asked you about it."
    s "It’s just a personal matter that the two of us decided to handle on our own instead of enlisting the help of everyone else. "

    scene amidatecafe7
    with dissolve

    a "Personal?"
    s "That’s what I said."
    a "..."
    s "Now, since we’re done talking about-"
    a "How personal, Sensei?"
    s "Excuse me?"
    a "What do you mean by “personal?” That makes it sound like you two have a relationship deeper than just teacher and student."
    s "Maybe we do?"
    a "Are you friends now?"
    s "Sure. I guess so."
    a "Then how come you were avoiding her so much when it seemed like she needed you most? That doesn’t sound very friend-like."
    s "Here’s a better idea- how about we eat and get back to our {i}date?{/i} Doesn’t that sound good, Ami?"
    a "No. You two stopped talking for two months and are now back to acting like nothing ever happened. I want to know what caused it."
    s "And I want you to mind your own business."
    a "But your business {i}is{/i} my business. I can’t make you happy if I don’t know how to get rid of what’s making you sad."
    s "Molly was never {i}making me sad.{/i} I just...needed time to think about some things."
    a "..."
    s "..."

    scene amidatecafe1
    with dissolve

    a "Molly’s so pretty. Isn’t she, Sensei?"
    a "Her skin is so pale and soft...and her eyes are so blue that you can get lost in them if you stare for too long."
    s "What are you getting at?"
    a "Nothing~ Just thinking about running away with her and stuff."
    s "Well, make sure to write if you do. I’ll be renting out your room for extra money."

    scene amidatecafe3
    with dissolve

    a "Just like that?! You’re not even going to try and get me to stay?!"
    a "Also, never joke about renting out my room! I can hear Ayane unzipping her wallet as we speak!"
    s "Is it safe to say we’re moving on now? Or are you going to keep trying to ruin the date you literally forced me to come on?"

    scene amidatecafe8
    with dissolve

    a "We can move on...I don’t want to ruin anything."
    a "I just get kinda jealous when I’m not in the loop and it feels like there have been a lot more loops than normal lately."
    a "But you can talk to me about stuff if you ever need advice, Sensei."

    scene amidatecafe9
    with dissolve

    a "If it’s something involving you, you can pretty much guarantee that I’m the number one person to come to! I’d put more care into advice for you than I would for even myself!"
    s "That’s bad and you should always prioritize yourself over other people."
    a "I refuse!"
    a "You need to be happy or my entire existence is meaningless!"
    s "I can’t imagine your parents would have been very happy to hear that while you were talking to them earlier."

    scene amidatecafe10
    with dissolve

    a "Oh. Uhh...Can you maybe...stop joking about them like that?"
    a "I’m obviously trying to be a little more open about what happened, but...I’d prefer if we could still be kind of sensitive about it."
    a "Today was a big step for me. And even though you were there to hold my hand, I’m going to keep working at it so I can maybe walk on my own some day."
    s "Sure. I didn’t really mean it as a joke. I-"
    a "I know, I know. Sudden mentions of them just throw me off."
    a "Like, it doesn’t completely register that they’re gone until {i}after{/i} the sentence registers. "
    a "It’s like there’s another mini accident inside of my mind each time I- nope. Nope. Don’t want to think about this anymore."
    s "Then think about something else. Like how you haven’t even touched your food yet and I’m already finished eating."

    scene amidatecafe11
    with dissolve

    a "Oh my God, already? Who are you, Maya?"
    s "It’s not like we just sat down. We’ve been here for a while. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if your food was already cold."

    scene amidatecafe12
    with dissolve

    a "Has it really been that long?..."
    a "Sorry, I’m just..."
    a "I’m a little nervous because there’s something I’ve been wanting to show you...and I don’t think I’m really gonna get a better time than this date to do that."

    "Ami curls her fingers around the base of her ponytail and begins to bob it up and down."
    "I’ve seen her do this in the past when she gets nervous- which is strange since she’s been twintailed for the majority of the time I’ve spent with her and I’ve never seen her do it then."
    "Either way, I can tell that she’s being honest again. I just don’t know what it is that she’d get so nervous about telling me when, if anything, she’s one of the most commonly open people I know."

    s "Is the thing you’ve been wanting to show me the next stop on our trip?"
    a "No...it’s actually...something I have on me now."
    s "So...a present?"
    a "Not really...but...also kind of?"
    a "I don’t know. It’s probably dumb. "
    s "You’re right. It probably is."

    scene amidatecafe13
    with dissolve

    a "Hey! "
    a "You’re supposed to say, “It won’t be dumb if it comes from you, Ami! You’re amazing and pretty!”"
    s "You’re pretty, yeah. But you’re also kind of an idiot."

    scene amidatecafe14
    with dissolve

    a "But...I..."
    s "You’re my idiot, though."

    if bonus == True:
        s "Which is a weird thing to say since I’m technically claiming ownership of you and I don’t technically enjoy being a legal guardian-"
        s "But it is what it is."

    scene amidatecafe15
    with dissolve

    a "How did you manage to turn calling me an idiot into one of the sweetest things you’ve ever said to me?"
    s "I’ve always had a way with words, I guess."
    a "Yeah..."
    a "And that’s exactly why I’m so nervous about this."
    s "What do you-"

    scene amidatecafe16
    with dissolve

    "Ami slides a sheet of paper out of the bag she’d been keeping by her feet and holds it out in front of her."
    "Her eyes scan the page for an excuse to back down, but I guess they aren’t able to uncover any as she remains silent apart from the audible tapping of her feet underneath the table."

    a "So..."
    a "Believe it or not, I’ve never been very good at expressing my feelings."
    s "I don’t believe that at all. All you do is express your feelings."

    scene amidatecafe17
    with dissolve

    a "I know that. But it...never feels like I can properly get everything that I’m trying to say out."
    a "And I don’t think I will today either, but...I remember you telling me something a long time ago about how poems were how people like that could find a way to survive in this world."
    a "It didn’t make much sense at the time since I was just a kid...but I think I kind of understand it now."
    a "So I thought I’d give it a try."
    a "It’s just kinda nerve wracking since I know you were like...a poetry expert a long time ago."
    s "You...wrote me a poem?"

    scene amidatecafe18
    with dissolve

    a "I...tried to."
    a "I don’t know if it’s any good, though."
    s "Well, that’s...unexpected."
    a "How come?"
    s "You’ve just never seemed like the “writer” type to me."
    a "Right. I’m the “idiot” type to you."
    a "But I tried really hard, so..."

    scene amidatecafe19
    with dissolve

    a "Here goes nothing."
    s "..."
    a "..."

    "Ami stops tapping her feet and focuses whatever energy she was using on that to stabilize her hands."
    "It’s easy to spot her nerves with how much the paper she wrote this on is trembling, and I’m sure she notices this as well as she needs to readjust her fingers a few times just to be able to read it."
    "I’m not sure what to expect, but I know now that however bad it is, I’m going to have to make sure that she thinks it’s good."
    "Such is the job of an [uncle]. And such is the job of-"

    a "I named this poem “My Life With You.”"
    a "..."
    s "..."
    a "A room full of sunshine, blacked out by a sheet.\nIt was there you and I were destined to meet."
    a "Not for the first time, you’ve been there from the start.\nBut that room full of sunshine filled a hole in my heart."
    a "We both couldn’t see it, but we knew it was there.\nSo with holes in our clothing and knots in our hair-"
    a "We’d get out of bed for just minutes each day.\nWe didn’t speak much, there was nothing to say."
    a "But one day that changed and the dark disappeared.\nWe took down that sheet and we faced what we feared."
    a "You became my world, since the old one was gone.\nThen one day it hit me, like I’d known all along."
    a "No sheet can contain the light from the sun.\nAnd all darkness must die once daylight’s begun."
    a "I guess it sounds silly, but I know that it’s true."
    a "A room full of sunshine- that’s my life with you."
    s "..."
    a "..."

    a "Ta-da. I love you."
    s "That was..."

    scene amidatecafe21
    with dissolve

    a "Wait. I don’t know if I’m ready to be made fun of yet. I know it was bad, but I worked really hard and-"
    s "No, Ami. That was way better than I expected."

    scene amidatecafe22
    with dissolve

    a "It...was?"
    a "But you’re only saying that because you expected literally nothing, right? Like I could have said {i}anything{/i} and it would have been better than what you were expecting."
    s "No, I mean I genuinely liked it and I’m really impressed you were able to write that."

    scene amidatecafe23
    with dissolve

    "I just wish that I could bask a little longer in the relevancy it has pertaining to my relationship with Ami."
    "I’m sure that day will come eventually, and I’m sure those memories may find a way to sneak back into my mind."
    "But for now, I’ll have to take her words for nothing more than their face value and the connotations tied to them."
    "And even though it all still seems a little surreal-"
    "I think I better understand why Ami feels the way she does about me now."
    "It’s just not a very good reason."

    a "You really liked it?! You don’t think I’m a failure and that I should give up on poetry immediately?!"
    s "I don’t."
    s "In fact, I think you should write more."

    scene amidatecafe24
    with dissolve

    a "Oh my God, Sensei...you have no idea how much of a relief it is to hear that."
    s "Did you really think I was going to just tell you to quit after hearing that?"

    scene amidatecafe25
    with dissolve

    a "A little..."
    a "I wrote this a little while ago, but...when I was going through some of Mom’s stuff last night, I found a bunch of her old poetry and remembered how much you liked it."
    a "I never really understood what the appeal of poems was back then, but reading them now...I think I finally get it."
    a "She had such an...um...eloquent way of writing? Is eloquent the right word?"
    s "..."

    scene amidatecafe26
    with dissolve

    a "You know what? I’ll just read one that I took a picture of and you can let me know if I’m on the right track."

    "The glass once held water, but it will never hold anything again."
    "I watch the shattering as if my world is plunged into slow motion."
    "Each shard moves in a different direction, some moving more distance than others without rhyme or reason as to why."
    "I am sure there is a scientific explanation for it, but I’d prefer to imagine it’s just random chance."
    "A nearby table joins in on the action and watches on, mesmerized as well."

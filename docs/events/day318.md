    scene thisiswar3
    with dissolve

    u "Ugh...stupid standardized test thingies...showing up out of nowhere and reminding us that we’re not all just cruisin’ by without havin’ to work for it."
    i "Hey, I’m totally down to help you. I just need to know a little more about what you’re struggling with."

    "Hello there."
    "As you can see, the class is hard at work today. "
    "Though, some are finding a bit more success than others."
    "I actually don’t mind days like this, where the girls are suddenly hit with reminders through my faithful class representative that they can’t slack off {i}every{/i} day-"
    "Because that just means things will be quieter than normal."
    "When things are quieter than normal, I have an easier time sleeping through the[school] day."
    "And the sooner the[school] day ends, the sooner I can do the things I actually want to do."
    "IE: Not be in[school]."
    "It’s a little weird how, even though I don’t do any teaching at all, it’s still mentally and physically draining being inside of this place."
    "I guess that’s just one of the effects[school] can have on the mind."
    "Regardless, I’m glad that things are slowing down today."

    i "I’m pretty sure we get held back if we fail any of them. "
    u "Well then what the heck is the point of normal tests and normal grades if the standardy ones are the only ones that matter?"
    i "You...do realize we haven’t taken a single “normal” test since we got here, right? They’re like, not even a thing anymore."

    scene thisiswar5

    u "Life itself is a test, dearest Io."
    u "From the moment we are born to the moment we get cancer and die, every day is a test to see if we’re fit to survive."

    u "So unless you plan on picking up my brain and replacing it with one that has more words, I think you’re better off just going back to your own seat."

    scene thisiswar9

    "And by “everyone else” I mean Imani, Makoto, and Nodoka- who have closed themselves off in the bedroom and are now casually drinking and discussing-"

    ima "I’m telling you guys, genomics is the way of the future!"

    "Ahh, yes. They are discussing that."

    s "Hey, everyone. I’m here now, which means we can talk about interesting things."
    mak "You really think so, Miss Imai? You’re not worried about the prospects of things like...gene editing? Because I think the stigma surrounding that is rather well-deserved."

    scene imaniandgirls2
    with dissolve

    ima "Ugh! Can you stop it with the “Miss Imai” stuff? I told you to call me Imani. Miss Imai is my cat."
    no "You have a cat?"

    scene imaniandgirls3
    with dissolve

    ima "Yeah. Miss Imai. I literally just told you that. Are you drunk already?"
    no "If I was drunk, I’d be in your lap."
    s "Ahem."

    scene imaniandgirls4
    with dissolve

    no "Or yours."
    ima "Ayyy! Look who it is! I was starting to think I’d have to chaperone this party by myself!"
    s "Well you seem to be doing a great job judging by the alcohol in my students’ hands."
    no "Interesting. You’ve never cared about that before, Sensei. "
    no "Could it be that you’re simply trying to impress our new, and quite beautiful student teacher?"

    scene imaniandgirls5
    with dissolve

    ima "Oh gosh! Is that true?! But...no! We shouldn’t! "
    ima "You’re my senpai! It wouldn’t be right!"
    s "I’m not trying to impress anyone. In fact, I couldn’t care less what you girls drink. I just figured Imani was going to be the responsible one out of the two of us- not just another me."

    scene imaniandgirls6
    with dissolve

    ima "You girls good?"
    mak "I’m fine."
    no "Same here."

    scene imaniandgirls7
    with dissolve

    ima "They say they’re good."
    s "How did this even happen? I thought Makoto was basically going to be at war with you for the rest of forever."

    scene imaniandgirls8
    with dissolve

    mak "Actually, I’m really starting to come around to Miss Imai! It turns out that she isn’t just an impostor after all! She’s actually really smart!"
    ima "Mwahaha yes, bow to the true teacher of...whatever class we are in!"
    s "Well, as long as you don’t start taking a cut of my salary, I’m fine with whatever."

    scene imaniandgirls9
    with dissolve

    mak "You should honestly be happy you’re still getting paid at all, Sensei. I’m beginning to think the reason I didn’t know about Miss Imai coming in is that even {i}my{/i} reputation is starting to diminish because of you."
    s "What? Why?"
    mak "Obviously because I spend all of my time doing your dirty work and, for some strange reason, have not filed a single formal complaint about it."
    mak "Which, you know, I really should have on account of all of those times you’ve been utterly horrible to me."
    s "Well thanks, Makoto. I’ll make it up to you soon. Really."

    scene imaniandgirls10
    with dissolve

    mak "Oh! Um...oh."
    s "Do you not want me to?"
    mak "No, of course I do. I just thought you were being serious for a second when you’d obviously never go out of your way for-"
    s "I’m serious. You just wait. "

    "There’s a chance I’m only thinking this due to an infection brought on by the sensation of Christmas cheer oozing into every one of my pores, but...I really should do something nice for Makoto."
    "It’s one thing to constantly burden her by turning her into my “at-school Ami” in the fact that she does {i}everything{/i} for me-"
    "But if doing all of that is actually making her feel bad...I should at least try {i}something.{/i}"

    no "So, Imani, do you truly intend to stay with our class for better or for worse? Or is this a temporary thing for you before getting a class of your own?"

    scene imaniandgirls11
    with dissolve

    ima "Depends on how much this guy likes me, I guess."
    ima "I don’t think there are any openings for full-on teachers right now. Especially with that other school still way, way, way underground."
    ima "I’m kinda just doing what I’m told since I can’t really afford to be fucking around currently."
    s "What do you mean you can’t afford it? What is the school paying you, exactly?"
    ima "Not much, dude. I don’t even have a place to stay right now."

    scene imaniandgirls12
    with dissolve

    mak "What do you mean you don’t have a place to stay? Where have you been sleeping? "
    no "Where has the {i}cat{/i} been sleeping?"
    ima "I’ve got a few months left of a spa membership thing, so I’ve kinda just been crashing over there every night. "
    no "You can probably stay with me if you’d like. And this isn’t me just being predatorial. Though, I certainly {i}can{/i} be if that’s what you want."
    ima "It’s fine. Like I said, I’ve got a couple months left until it {i}really{/i} becomes a problem. "
    ima "And I’m also pretty sure I remember the school telling me something about maybe opening up another floor in the dorm for me to stay in, so I’m just hoping that’s all set up by then."
    mak "Which dorm? Our dorm? Or the one down the road from ours?"
    ima "Pretty sure it’s yours. Would be kinda weird if it wasn't."
    s "What the hell? Why don’t I get a room at that dorm? That would save me so much walking."

    scene imaniandgirls13
    with dissolve

    mak "Probably because you’d never leave."
    no "I extend the same invite I gave to Imani to you, Sensei. Though, I think Otoha would be a bit more hesitant to sleep in the same room as you on account of our {i}relationship.{/i}"
    ima "This something I’m gonna have to report to the higher-ups?"
    s "Is that something you actually {i}would{/i} report to the higher ups?"

    scene imaniandgirls14
    with dissolve

    ima "Yo. Do you consent?"
    no "I consent to anything and everything. Let that fact be known."

    scene imaniandgirls15
    with dissolve

    ima "Nah, you good. I won’t say anything."
    s "There wouldn’t be anything to say either way since Nodoka and I don’t have any sort of relationship."
    ima "Your class is fucking weird, man. I know you’re a hot dude and stuff, but I didn’t really expect a whole tribe of girls fighting some kinda battle royale for your affection."
    mak "That...is actually a quite apt description of what our class has devolved into."

    scene imaniandgirls16
    with dissolve

    ima "Well, then I bet you’re glad you have me! "
    no "Do you intend to dismantle our battle royale, Imani? Or do you intend to {i}win{/i} it?"
    ima "I {i}intend{/i} to just talk about a bunch of cool shit and then say I’m not going to participate in the battle royale, but then probably get sucked in anyway because that’s how these kinda things go."

    if bonus == True:

        mak "How do you even have a fivesome?! That can’t possibly work!"
        no "If anyone would know how it would work, I imagine it would be you, dearest Makoto. What with all your wonderful mother has taught you and everything."

    scene imaniandgirls21

        ki "What are you talking about? I am literally only here because I heard the word “threesome.”"
    else:
        mak "What I {i}mean{/i} is that you can’t just hijack an intellectual conversation just because the huggy boy was brought up!"
        ki "But the script told me I was-"

    mak "Okay, fine. That topic was brought up. But before Sensei arrived, this was a fun, bonding experience between three smart people! And I never get to talk to smart people! Let me have this!"

    scene imaniandgirls22

    scene imaniandgirls23
    with dissolve

    ki "Maybe not Nodoka or Makoto smart, but I’m not a fucking idiot! I’m definitely above average at least!"
    s "Then...contribute and prove your worth or whatever it is Nodoka suggested."
    ki "What the fuck does that even- ugh!"

    scene imaniandgirls24
    with dissolve

    ki "Salutations, seasoned intellectuals. May I burden you with my presence in exchange for a tiny little tidbit of information relevant to my current state of being?"
    ki "Because I do believe it may help you all understand me a little better and all I {i}really{/i} want is to get along."

    if bonus == True:
        "Kirin leaves out the part about getting naked and fingering everyone, which is what I, a real intellectual, know she actually wants."

    mak "What is this “tidbit” of relevant information, Kirin? Because if it’s something as simple as just feeling left out, that’s hardly new information and changes absolutely nothing."
    no "Mmmmm...that depends. But I yield my time to the girl from dorm ten."

    scene imaniandgirls25
    with dissolve

    ki "Do you know what FOMO stands for, Makoto?"
    mak "The fear of missing out, obviously. But that’s no excuse for-"

    ki "And while it’s not technically a “new” psychological phenomenon, rapid advancements in technology have been making it significantly more common lately."
    ki "It’s even seeing a substantial increase in presence in medical journals- a thing that, surprise, I read! Because I’m a big, smart girl just like you!"
    ki "Oh! And did you know that the links between FOMO and more medically accepted conditions like anxiety and depression are gathering more and more support every year?"
    ki "Would you tell someone that depression isn’t a good enough reason for their actions, Makoto? "
    ki "Or are you just caught up in the equally interesting psychological phenomenon of being a fucking bitch?"

    scene imaniandgirls26
    with dissolve

    ima "Damn, Makoto! You just gonna let her FO your MO like that?!"
    mak "That..."

    mak "Ugh. Fine. You win. I’m sorry."
    mak "You can stay and hang out with us. I didn’t mean to ostracize you. And now that I understand you’re psychologically compelled to-"

    scene imaniandgirls25
    with dissolve

    ki "Thanks but no thanks. I’m gonna go walk around the halls and try to find someone a little less smart to talk to since I’m not good enough for you."
    mak "Oh, come on. I didn’t mean it. I told you I’m sorry."

    scene imaniandgirls28
    with dissolve

    s "You worded that question in a way that makes it very hard for me to refuse without sounding like a complete asshole."
    ki "You’re already a complete asshole and have done much worse. But I suck too, so I guess we can just go suck together or something."

    if bonus == True:
        "I hope that has a double meaning."
        "Actually, knowing Kirin, it {i}probably{/i} has a double meaning."

    play sound "phonebeep.wav"

    "I tap on Kaori’s name in my phone and wait for her to answer."
    "She normally works around this time, so I imagine that’s what she’s doing now- but I think I’d still like to see her regardless."
    "In fact, I’m pretty positive that’s the case as I wouldn’t have selected her name without wanting that."
    "But I digress."

    play sound "phonebeep.wav"

    k "Greetings, Friend! I am very glad you telephoned!"

    "Oh, wow. An actual greeting this time."

    s "Oh yeah? And why is that?"
    k "I require the large, muscley tubes you have attached to your human shoulders."
    s "They are called arms. And why?"
    k "I have been asked to go to a place and get things but I can’t get things since my shoulder-tubes are weak and not good at lifting multiple objects at once."
    s "So I’m guessing you need help getting things from the store and bringing them back to your work?"
    k "My description was better. But yes!"
    k "Please come. I will pay you in what humans call “high fives.”"
    s "Humans don’t usually pay each other in those but okay. It’s not like I had anything else to do."
    k "That is great news!"
    k "Meet me at the store in twenty minutes!"

    play sound "phonebeep.wav"

    "Kaori hangs up the phone and I quickly find myself throwing on clothes before heading out the door."

    s "She never told me what store..."

    "……"

    k "I’m sorry again for never telling you where to meet me."
    k "I would have answered you sooner but my phone was on moon-mode so the harsh light of the sun would not destroy it."
    s "That moon icon is just the “Do not disturb” setting."
    k "That cannot be true as you were still able to disturb me."
    s "I..."
    s "Okay."
    k "And thank you for buying me this delicious sphere of cookie bread. "
    s "You haven’t even taken a bite yet."
    k "I am absorbing the scent through my pointed dual face openings."
    s "Nostrils. Or nose. Either one works. “Pointed dual face openings” is not an acceptable alternative."

    scene kaoriconvenience2
    with dissolve

    k "And also, thank you again for assisting me today."
    k "I never would have imagined that the strange man who wandered into my store with his adorable [niece] would one day traverse the streets of the city with me."
    k "This would probably be a dream come true if I were able to dream."
    s "That wouldn’t exactly be an exciting dream."
    k "Lies. I am filled with excitement. And also sugar as this is my third cookie bread."
    s "We’re only five feet outside of the store. How are you already on your third? That’s some Maya level speed."

    scene kaoriconvenience3
    with dissolve

    k "Maya?"
    k "What is a Maya?"
    k "Another small girl?"
    s "Yeah. My [niece]’s friend. You’ve probably seen her around since you work in like eighty-seven restaurants."
    k "What does she look like?"
    k "Does she have hair? Eyes?"
    k "How many eyes?"
    s "What? Two. And also yes, she has hair. Those are both normal things for humans to have."
    k "Then it is highly possible she has crossed my path. I have seen many girls with eyes."
    k "Sometimes, I stare at them for too long and they run away."
    s "That’s a standard reaction to staring at girls."
    k "Do girls also run from you, Friend?"
    s "Surprisingly, not really."
    k "That {i}is{/i} surprising. You are large and intimidating. "
    k "Your size is one of the main reasons I was excited for you to see me this morning."
    s "I’m glad that you’re using me for my ability to carry groceries."

    scene kaoriconvenience4
    with dissolve

    k "I would have done it myself but my shoulder-tubes are bad. They don’t move the way they should if I use them too much."
    s "Aren’t you using them all day in the restaurant?"
    k "Just for a few thousand milliseconds at a time. The time is negligible."
    s "Why do you know words like “negligible” but not “arms?”"

    scene kaoriconvenience5
    with dissolve

    k "The word used does not matter nearly as much as the meaning."
    k "It’s just like referring to a mother. Everyone has their own word and they all mean the same thing."
    k "Why is it not acceptable to do the same with objects or appendages?"
    s "Because those things are a lot less personal than a family member. But I guess it doesn’t really matter."
    k "It does not. You should know that as my teacher so that you do not charge me for your false instructions. "
    s "I already told you I’m not going to charge you for helping you with your...language skills. I’m doing this because I want you to succeed in the world."
    k "Your words sound kind but your face says you want me to fail."
    s "That’s just how my face looks. I can promise I don’t want you to fail."

    scene kaoriconvenience6
    with dissolve

    k "I appreciate your face. Even if it roots for my demise."
    s "Well...Thank you. I think."
    k "Apology accepted."
    s "…"

    scene kaoriconvenience7
    with dissolve

    k "Friend, I have a question for you. "
    k "Do you think that there are things in this world that are not worth fixing?"
    s "Like, things that are already broken or-"
    k "Or things that are bound to break."
    k "I feel weak and insignificant forcing someone so special to me to make up for what I lack in tube-strength."
    s "Again, I’m doing this because I want to."
    k "Yes but carrying bags does not make for an exciting date. We should be carrying each other's diaries from our elementary[school] years."
    s "What kind of weird expectation of a date is that?"
    k "It sounded fun in my head. I would like to see the things young-Friend thought when he was not so filled with anguish and meat."
    s "Hate to break it to you but I never had a diary. Those are more of a girl thing."

    scene kaoriconvenience8
    with dissolve

    k "Then what did you use as a boy to get your feelings out?"
    k "You were not the type to terrorize small animals or destroy mailboxes, were you?"
    s "Uhh, no."
    s "I don’t remember much about my childhood, but I’ve never really done anything to “get my feelings out.”"
    s "Even if I were to express something, I don’t know what it would be."
    k "Do you not feel?"
    s "I definitely feel."
    s "Just...not as much, I guess?"

    "What’s the use in self-expression anyway?"
    "Sure, you might get short bursts of self-satisfaction or the chance to reflect on ideas you’ve had in the past-"
    "But as time goes by, looking back on those things just brings more pain than it does anything else."
    "The fact that those fragments of your former self still float around in the ether until you’re unfortunate enough to watch them resurface is just further proof that we should all sit around and sulk until we die."
    "Love, me."

    k "Then do you not know happiness?"
    s "I know happiness just as much as I know sadness or anger. I just choose not to react to them."

    scene kaoriconvenience9
    with dissolve

    k "This makes me sad. I will now react, like a normal, non-Friend human."
    k "I want to see you smile the way I smile when I return to my living quarters and find John pecking away at a cooked fast food hamburger."
    s "Didn’t I tell you to stop feeding him h-"
    k "You told me no such thing. "

    scene kaoriconvenience10
    with dissolve

    k "If you are to not express joy when you are happy or tears when you cry, what am I to do as your friend?"
    k "I have no tears left in my body, but if I were to magically regenerate them and cry like a small human, I would want you to understand my sadness."
    s "You really don’t have to worry about me. I’m fine."

    scene kaoriconvenience11
    with dissolve

    k "No! It is exactly my job as a friend to worry. I shall not back down because you are afraid of happiness."
    s "I’m not {i}afraid{/i} of happiness..."
    k "Do you understand my concern, Friend? "
    s "Not really, but I don’t understand anything you do so I’ve kind of just accepted it at this point."
    k "I say these things to you so that you may find peace!"
    k "This world is filled with trouble! Horrible things!"
    k "But take heart, Friend. The Queen of Spiders has overcome this world!"
    k "And if I must overcome it once more to make you smile, I will! "
    k "Unless overcoming it again means returning John. That is where I draw the line."
    s "Returning your chicken wouldn’t really do anything for me either way, so I wouldn’t worry about that."

    scene kaoriconvenience12
    with dissolve

    k "All this being said, will you now attempt to express your feelings more?"
    k "Right now may not be a good time as your hands are clenched around the plastic handles of grocery-receptacles, but if you would like to try dancing I will promise not to laugh."
    s "Can we talk about something else? I can’t say I’m a fan of being coaxed out of the shell I’ve built around myself."
    k "We can talk about other shelled-creatures if you’d like."
    k "My personal favorite is the tortoise. "
    k "And if I had to choose which animal would represent you in an all-animal reenactment of our relationship, it is the third animal I would choose for the part."
    s "How about something completely unrelated to shelled-creatures? "
    k "Like what?"
    s "I don’t know. Tell me more about yourself."
    s "Were you always this...expressive when you were a kid?"

    scene kaoriconvenience13
    with dissolve

    k "You want to hear about Mini-Kaori?"
    s "You refer to your childhood self as Mini-Kaori?"
    k "She is the miniature version of me, so yes."

    scene kaoriconvenience14
    with dissolve

    k "My memories of those days are enshrouded in fog, so this may not be as true as it should be."
    k "But I believe I may have openly felt things not common of people in my age group."
    k "Mini-Kaori had just as many friends as she has now. Only one."
    k "But the old friend disappeared when I-"

    k "EEK!"

    "Kaori drops her melon bread on the ground the second her phone starts ringing."

    k "I forgot to align my phone with the moon again after responding to your cries for help!"
    k "The sudden noise startled me! My third cookie bread is ruined!"
    s "You should probably answer your phone, at least. It’s probably your work."
    s "We’ve been standing in this parking lot for quite some time now and my arms are starting to get tired anyway."
    k "R-Right! Telephone!"

    scene kaoriconvenience16

    k "T-Telephone?"
    s "Why are you holding it like that?"
    k "…"
    k "Uh-huh."
    k "The leeks are safe and secure in plastic containers carried by a large man."
    k "…"
    k "No, I am not in danger."
    k "He is my friend and he does not know how to express himself."
    s "Was that information really necessary to give out?"
    k "…"
    k "Yes, I will return shortly."

    scene kaoriconvenience17
    with dissolve

    k "…"
    k "No, I do not see one."
    s "See what? Now what are you talking about?"
    k "My manager said there was a large sky-football passing over the city."

    "She must be talking about a blimp."

    k "He knows how much I like them so I must remain vigilant in order to see it."
    s "What kind of person loves-"
    s "Actually, you’re exactly the kind of person that would love something like that."
    k "…"
    k "Heard."
    k "I will return before the sun begins to die."
    k "Sayonara."

    play sound "phonebeep.wav"
    scene kaoriconvenience18
    with dissolve

    "Kaori hangs up her phone and looks at me with a sudden flood of disappointment in her eyes."

    k "I am sorry, Friend, but I must return to work now."
    s "I mean, I still have to carry all of these for you, so you don’t have to say goodbye just yet."
    k "Oh. That is correct."
    k "If I took them from you, they would end up as dinner for the cement. And cement does not eat so this would benefit no one."
    s "I’m glad we’re on the same page."

    scene kaoriconvenience19
    with dissolve

    k "Thank you again for your assistance. "
    k "I promise to return the favor in the future once my arms return to their full strength and you suddenly begin to wither away into dust."
    s "I will keep that in mind..."

    "The two of us continue our walk back to the diner and, within less than twenty minutes, we’re there."
    "Kaori and I part ways-"
    "But not before she remembers to pay me in roughly seven high-fives that she apparently believes are an actual form of human currency."

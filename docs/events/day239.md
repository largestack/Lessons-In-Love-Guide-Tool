    "I open the door and move out into the hallway."
    "It’s cold today."
    "Granted, it’s cold pretty much every day now on account of that whole “Winter” thing-"
    "But it feels even colder than it’s supposed to be, if you know what I’m talking about."
    "It’s that weird temperature where your clothes seem two sizes tighter than normal and any residual moisture on your hair only slightly-freezes instead of getting completely hard."
    "It’s a special kind of coldness."
    "It somehow sneaks in through closed windows and air vents, turning this once-warm sanctuary of sorts into a frozen hellscape."
    "And there’s someone I know who reminds me a lot of that very specific and particular feeling."

    scene mayaanduta1
    with dissolve

    m "Hey."
    s "Yo. "
    s "Why are you just standing with your back to the window like you're trapped in some sort of game CG?"
    m "There’s something I felt the two of us should discuss."
    m "We haven’t had a substantial conversation since Christmas, and as much as I love that, I can’t go on perpetually ignoring the situation."
    s "Are you...confessing to me?"

    scene mayaanduta2
    with dissolve

    m "Uhh, what? No. Not even close."
    s "Worth a shot."

    scene mayaanduta3
    with dissolve

    m "It’s about our last meeting on the roof. And how the strange level of confidence I had that night bore no fruit whatsoever."
    s "And what better place to talk about something as serious as that than a hallway full of students, right?"

    scene mayaanduta4

    if bonus == True:
        m "High school girls are kind of like snow- beautiful, yet fleeting."
    else:
        m "Girls are kind of like snow- beautiful, yet fleeting."

    m "Before you know it, they're gone."
    m "Look around you. What do you see?"

    "I turn around to find the same strangers as always, passing by and paying little to no attention."
    "I can’t help but think about the horrible things I would do to some of them if given the opportunity, but for now they’re all just-"

    s "Empty..."

    scene mayaanduta5
    with dissolve

    m "Careful. Your thoughts seem to be spilling out of your head."
    m "Something like that could prove extremely detrimental to your “career.”"
    m "Do you see what I’m saying now, though?"
    s "That no one is paying any attention and that even if they overheard our conversation they probably wouldn’t think anything of it?"

    scene mayaanduta6
    with dissolve

    m "Oh, wow. You actually do."
    m "Color me surprised."
    s "So, what’s going on? Are you trying to blame this[school] thing on our rooftop-meeting?"

    scene mayaanduta7
    with dissolve

    m "That’s just the thing..."
    m "Things have {i}changed{/i} before but...never like this."
    m "An everlasting[school] year filled with the same old faces and the same old seating arrangements-"
    m "That’s all I’ve had for god-knows how long at this point."
    s "Shouldn’t you be excited that you get to see something new then?"

    scene mayaanduta8
    with dissolve

    m "I believe I’ve made it very apparent that anything {i}new{/i} is not ideal for me."
    m "This also makes me sound like a bit of an idiot- spouting all of those things about how life is a cycle only to have something like {i}this{/i} go and happen just shortly after."
    s "Sounds like a pretty intense inner-struggle you’ve got going on there."
    m "…"
    s "…"

    scene mayaanduta9
    with dissolve

    m "…"
    m "Yup."

    "I want to say more to comfort Maya but..."
    "Well, I’m pretty sure that I’m even lower on the list of things that would calm her than having a cavity drilled or having to bury a child."
    "That second one may be a bit of a stretch, but what I’m essentially saying is that there isn’t anything I can do for her."
    "Or, at least I don’t think there is."
    "And I’ll probably always think that since, even now, in her most vulnerable or...confused (?) moments, she’s still miles away from me."

    m "Like I was saying, I don’t expect you to do anything. Or even care, for that matter."
    m "I just thought it would only be right to inform you that..."
    m "I might not know what’s coming next."
    s "…"

    scene mayaanduta10
    with dissolve

    m "But, then again, this could all just be some sort of hiccup."
    m "A glitch in the matrix, if you will."
    m "It’s very possible that everything will go back to normal in the middle of the season, the way it’s done so many times before."
    m "And you’ll have to say goodbye to whoever your next prey may be."
    s "How come you always need to make me sound like some sort of predator?"

    scene mayaanduta11
    with dissolve

    m "Is that an actual question? Because I’ve got a pretty drawn-out response in the event that it is."
    s "You can tell me the whole thing on the way home if you want."
    m "I’m not going home with you. This is exactly why I called you a predator."
    m "And even if I was, that wouldn't be enough time."
    s "At least come downstairs with me, then. I’ve already been spending too much time here lately and I want to get out as quickly as I can."
    m "I suppose I can walk downstairs with you since I also need to do that in order to leave."
    s "Then it’s a date."
    m "It most certainly is not."

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "Maya and I leave the third floor, the one we spend roughly one-third of our lives on, and head toward the lockers."
    "The snow- Err, the students that crowded the hall just minutes ago have mostly dispersed, leaving several stragglers behind amidst puddles of dirty water in front of the entrance."
    "Or exit, in some cases."
    "A door that people move through."
    "Let’s just call it that."

    scene mayaanduta12
    with dissolve2

    m "You didn’t have to stop at my locker, you know."
    s "Sorry, I wanted to know where I should be dropping off the love-letter I’ve been writing to you."
    m "I think it would reach me best if you’d just toss it into the nearest active fireplace."
    s "Speaking of active fireplaces-"
    m "What can you possibly be segueing into with that?"
    s "Is it really possible for things to go back to normal again after the next reset?"
    m "Oh, something completely unrelated to fireplaces. That’s on-brand."

    scene mayaanduta13
    with dissolve

    m "I’m not sure..."
    m "The city itself is unfazed by all of the time-skips, it seems."
    m "It’s the same reason new buildings keep popping up- and how the weather still changes."
    m "How I imagine it will work if it does go back to normal-"
    m "No, {i}when{/i} it goes back to normal- is that the second[school] will go up again and, before long, everyone will filter back in."
    m "Think of it like buying a new tank and filling it with fish."
    s "Why do we always need a metaphor? I understood what you meant the first time."
    m "I like metaphors."
    m "They’re one of the few things that make everything seem more real."

    "She’s right about that, at least."
    "Well, not the metaphor part. The part about how this doesn’t feel real."
    "Which is a strange thing for me to say given that nothing about this place is real..."
    "But...how can I say this?"
    "A[school] sinking into the ground and everyone having to transfer here? That’s just ridiculous."
    "Things like that don’t happen."
    "Entire[school]s don’t fall into the ground."
    "But I guess when you don’t know what’s beneath you-"

    "Uta-chan is going to be in my class."

    with dissolve

    u "Just to let you know, I probs can’t call you Master in[school]. I think that would get both of us in lots of trouble."

    with dissolve

    u "Or Japanese question...or English question..."

    scene mayaanduta27
    with dissolve

    u "Easier? What do you mean?"

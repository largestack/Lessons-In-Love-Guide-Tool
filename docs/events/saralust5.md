    scene sarafirstlust1

    play music "calmbar.mp3"

    "I show up at the bar to find both Sara and Sana waiting behind the counter with nothing to do."
    "Obviously, this has become par for the course here. But it still seems depressing enough for me to point out any chance I get."

    sar "Well, well, well. If it isn't my favorite customer."
    sa "It's...not like we really have another choice..."

    scene sarafirstlust2
    with dissolve

    sar "That’s not true! Haruka shows up every once in a while."
    sar "Oh! And there’s also that group of old ladies who sit in the back of the room and drink a disturbing amount of whiskey."
    s "Sorry for asking, but would you mind telling me exactly what constitutes a “disturbing amount” of whiskey?"

    scene sarafirstlust3
    with dissolve

    sar "Sure. But only if you promise to try and one-up them so I can pay this month’s rent."
    s "You mean to tell me your ability to pay rent depends entirely on how much whiskey I consume tonight?"
    sar "If you'd prefer to just {i}give{/i} me the money instead of getting alcohol poisoning, I'd accept that too."
    sar "Any contribution you make gets me one step closer to keeping my bed so I don't wind up in my daughter's after getting evicted."

    scene sarafirstlust4
    with dissolve

    sa "Wait...what?..."
    sa "You’re not...seriously going to move into my dorm room if that happens...are you?"
    sar "Sana! You wouldn’t let your mother go to sleep on the street would you? I raised you better than that."
    sa "But I...also don’t want to sleep in the same bed as my mom..."
    sar "Why not? We slept in the same bed all the way up until you were-"

    scene sarafirstlust5
    with dissolve

    sa "So...Sensei! Umm...how are you doing today?"
    s "I’m good, Sana. Thanks for asking."
    sar "Oh no! Is my little girl all grown up now?! Am I no longer good enough for her?!"
    sar "This is a mother’s worst nightmare!"
    sar "I have feelings, Sana! I have feelings and you are hurting them!"
    sa "Don’t listen to her...She...doesn’t actually have feelings..."
    sa "And she’s...not allowed to sleep in my bed..."

    scene sarafirstlust6
    with dissolve

    sar "Hmm...Well, if that’s the way things are going to be, I guess I’ll just have to find another bed to sleep in."
    sar "You wouldn’t happen to know of any openings...would you, Sensei?"
    sa "Umm...Mom?..."

    scene sarafirstlust7
    with dissolve

    sar "Sana."
    sa "What...are you doing?..."
    sar "Searching for a backup plan for when I get evicted because your teacher won’t buy our entire stock of whiskey."
    s "I don’t really need to buy it all at once, do I?"
    sar "You do if you care about me."
    s "I mean..."
    sa "Wait...um...maybe..."
    sa "Maybe I can ask Ayane...if it’s okay for you to stay with us..."

    scene sarafirstlust8
    with dissolve

    sa "Is there, umm...a rule against that...Sensei?"
    s "Sana, if there are rules about proper dorm room conduct, I can assure you that I am the absolute worst person to ask."
    sa "I don’t...really know what you mean by that..."
    sa "But I’m going to tell Ayane anyway..."
    s "Don’t worry about it. I’ll make sure your mom has a place to stay if she gets kicked out."

    scene sarafirstlust9
    with dissolve

    sa "Why would you say that?! That makes me worry even more!"
    sa "I...have to talk to Ayane!"
    sa "I’ll...I’ll be right back!"

    scene sarafirstlust10
    with dissolve

    sar "..."

    "Sana quickly pulls her phone out of her pocket and darts out of the bar into the street, leaving me alone with a now-blushing Sara."

    s "…"
    s "Listen, I was just-"
    sar "You...know I was just kidding, right?..."
    sar "I couldn't possibly ask you to do something like that for me..."
    sar "Did you...really mean that?"
    s "I can't guarantee my niece would be okay with it, but it's not like I'd let you just sleep on the street when I have a perfectly good house."
    sar "Thank you so much, but..."
    sar "I’ll figure something out. I always do."

    "I instinctively reach for my wallet to check how thick it is, knowing full well that I may have to spend a little more money here from this point on."

    scene sarafirstlust11
    with dissolve

    sar "I’m really surprised that Sana agreed to my suggestion that quickly, though. "
    sar "She must...{i}really{/i} not want me spending any more time with you."
    sar "Could it be that my daughter finally has her first crush?"

    scene sarafirstlust12
    with dissolve

    sar "And on the same boy as me...You know, I always thought my life was a little like a soap opera."
    sar "Either that or I'm just younger than I thought I was."

    "{i}Or{/i} Sana’s tastes are just a little bit more mature than they should be..."

    sar "Hey...How long do you think she’ll be gone for?"
    s "Sana? Isn’t she just making a phone call?"
    sar "Mhm. But who knows how long that could take? The reception over here is hooooorrible. It could be {i}days.{/i}"
    s "I highly doubt the reception here is that bad, but since I think I know where you're going with this, I'm going to pretend it is."

    scene sarafirstlust13
    with dissolve

    sar "Oh?..."
    sar "Could it be we have our minds on the same thing?..."

    "I obviously know where this is heading."
    "It seems kind of dangerous to initiate this when Sana is going to be back any moment, though."
    "But maybe..."
    "Maybe I can do something to satisfy {i}her{/i} before we’ve been gone “too long...”"

    s "I know that look, Sara."
    sar "What look? I don’t have a look."
    s "You most certainly do have a look."
    sar "Do I?"
    s "You do."
    sar "Hmm..."
    sar "Well if I {i}do{/i} have the look I think you’re talking about, I can’t imagine Sana would be happy to see it."
    sar "If only we had somewhere close by that we could sneak away t-"

    scene sarafirstlust14
    with dissolve

    sar "Oh, wait! How silly of me! I just remembered that I live right upstairs!"
    s "Wow. What a convenient turn of events that is."

    scene sarafirstlust13
    with dissolve

    sar "We can be quick...right, Sensei?~"
    s "We’d have to be {i}very{/i} quick."
    sar "Maaaaybe...if you carry a case of beer downstairs when we're done, I can tell Sana you were helping me with bar stuff?"
    s "And if she comes upstairs?"

    scene sarafirstlust15
    with dissolve

    sar "If she comes upstairs, I guess I’ll just have to keep quiet, won’t I?"
    s "Is that something you think you’re capable of? Because you’re normally pretty loud."
    sar "Heheh~"
    sar "Let’s hope we don’t have to find out..."

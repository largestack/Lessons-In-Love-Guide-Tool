    "I wound up getting a call from Makoto sometime last night about how Io was approved for switching classes today-"
    "And, as such, I’m meeting up with her in the hall beforehand to give her the crash course on my, uhh, {i}teaching{/i} methods."

    i "So, you’re telling me that all I’m going to have to do every day is just...show up?"
    s "Pretty much. "
    s "I think my original plan was more along the lines of “Show up and don’t be an asshole,” but we have one girl who wouldn’t even be allowed to come any more if that were the case."
    i "Can’t you just kick her out if you don’t want her? "
    s "Maybe? "
    s "She’s been getting better, though. Which I’m mildly surprised about since I haven’t done anything to really change her as of yet."
    i "That’s good, I guess. "
    i "I probably wasn’t ever going to talk to her anyway, but I feel a little safer now knowing you’ve already begun her rehabilitation process."
    s "Still sticking to your plan of just breezing by as a loner?"
    i "Kinda just gonna play the field, if you know what I mean."
    i "Feel things out. See who’s worth my time and who’s just another face in the hall."
    s "I can relate to that."

    "Or at least I feel like I could have related to that at some point."
    "My life’s become a vast departure from what I imagined it would be."
    "I’ve gotten to know so many people over the last few seasons and, honestly?"
    "I feel like I can even say I’ve enjoyed many parts of it."

    if bonus == True:
        "Particularly the parts where I get to have sex, but other parts have been good too."
    else:
        "Especially all the hugs."

    s "So, ready to do this?"

    scene iointro2
    with dissolve

    i "I’m fine with just hanging out in the hall instead."
    i "In fact, want to ditch class and go get breakfast or something? I’ll treat you."
    s "Getting cold feet, Io?"
    i "…"
    i "Something like that."

    scene iointro1
    with dissolve

    i "Sensei, do you remember all that stuff I was saying about how I would try not to be “too {i}me{/i}” when I joined the class?"
    s "I do remember you saying something along those lines, yes."
    i "Good."
    i "Now, what if I told you the reason I said that was that the real “me” isn’t fun or exciting to be around?"
    s "I’d say that there are plenty of people just like that."
    i "You think so?"
    s "Of course. I’m not particularly fun or exciting either and people keep gravitating toward me."

    if bonus == True:
        i "You’re an attractive guy in a[school] full of hormonal [teenager]s. Of course that’s going to happen."
    else:
        i "That is because you are a good boy in a school of bad girls."

    s "So, what? You’re worried everyone will think you’re boring?"
    i "Not boring. Inherently unlikable and unwilling to change."
    i "Kind of like the one asshole girl you were talking about before."
    i "If I come across as anything less than what you want me to be, will you try to change me as well?"
    s "That depends."
    i "On?"
    s "Whether you want to change or not."
    i "Do you {i}want{/i} me to change?"
    s "I don’t even {i}know{/i} you yet. We’ve had three conversations so far and they’ve all been completely different from one another."
    i "It’s not too late to back out, you know. I read the transfer thing and it doesn’t formally go through until the end of the[school] day."
    i "If you want to throw me out, you have every right to do that."
    i "And I won’t blame you if you do."
    i "I’m trash. This[school] is trash. Everything is trash."

    scene iointro3
    with dissolve

    i "Heheh~ Here I go again."
    i "You should have taken me up on that breakfast thing when I offered it."
    s "…"

    "Uhh."

    s "Are you okay?"
    i "…"
    s "…"
    i "Sensei?"
    s "Yeah?"
    i "I’m going to try to go in there and put on a smile."
    i "I’m gonna try to introduce myself to all of those girls-"
    i "But I want you to know that I might just wind up walking out halfway through."
    s "That’s where our new relationship comes in handy, then."
    s "Most teachers wouldn’t allow something like that. But you’re free to walk out whenever you want in my class."

    scene iointro4
    with dissolve

    i "And you're not even gonna let me finish building the wall..."
    i "You sure you don’t want to get breakfast with me? I’ll tell you all about why I am the way I am."
    s "I think it might be a little better for me to actually figure out what “the way you are” is first."
    i "Well damn. I guess that’s my cue to go say a bunch of stuff about myself then, huh?"
    s "Think you’re going to be able to handle it?"
    i "Of course. Assimilation isn’t optional. "
    i "If I need to blend in in order to get by, I’ll giggle and gossip the way good girls are groomed to."
    i "I’ll fake some interests and laugh at their horrible jokes."
    i "Heck, maybe I’ll intentionally trip on the way to my desk to show everyone that I’m clumsy and lovable."
    i "They’ll write me off as another normal girl-"

    scene iointro5
    with dissolve

    i "And never realize how broken I actually am."
    s "…"
    i "Watch me, Sensei."
    i "Watch me assimilate."

    "Io slides the door open and moves into the classroom before I’m able to think up a reasonable response."
    "But what would a reasonable response to that even be?"
    "I hate ruling out peoples’ troubles from the get-go...but what could be going on in that head of hers that would make her be so openly self-deprecating without any desire to change?"
    "If you’re going to complain about being trash, why not just...stop being trash?"

    "..."
    "It isn’t until I set foot into Class-A that I realize I’m like that, too."
    "How many times have I pointed out the flaws in myself, only to shrug them off and cast them aside?"
    "Perhaps Io is the same way?"
    "Or perhaps she’s a victim of circumstance-"
    "Not some guy with poor morals who was dropped into a world in which they’d run rampant."
    "………"
    "……"
    "…"

    scene iointro9

    i "…"
    ee "…"

    "In the event that this girl {i}is{/i}, as she suggests, trash, it probably isn’t a good idea to display her in front of a group of her peers and shine a light on her."
    "If that were you up there, far away from your safe little cubby in the back of the room, would you be happy?"
    "If you had knowingly informed someone that you were uncomfortable with yourself as a person and that someone immediately said “Go show everyone who you really are,” you’d hate them, right?"
    "In hindsight, that’s how I felt."
    "Or rather, that’s how I feel."
    "Because I can not resign myself to a small wooden box."
    "I must watch a lovely caterpillar squirm."
    "Trying desperately to cocoon itself."

    i "I’ll work on it."
    s "The hard part is already over. You can just do whatever you want from now on."
    s "Gotta say, though, that was definitely a strong first impression."
    i "I personally liked the part where I stood there and looked like an idiot for ten whole minutes."
    s "I think it was closer to like fifteen seconds, but yeah."
    i "Really? It felt a lot longer to me."
    s "That tends to happen when you’re the center of attention."

    scene iointro13
    with dissolve

    i "Ugh. Now people are probably going to try and ask me if everything is okay or if I’m nervous or blah blah blah."
    s "Is that really such a bad thing?"

    scene iointro14
    with dissolve

    i "Io fact number-one. Get your notebook ready."
    s "I should probably just commit whatever this is to memory. I don’t want to break out a notebook each time I see you."
    i "Previously on “Io Opens Up to a Guy She Just Met,” we learned that Io does not like people."
    i "This was a lie."
    i "Io specifically does not like girls."
    i "Also, Io is going to stop talking in third person now because she feels like a moron."
    s "Why just girls?"

    scene iointro15
    with dissolve

    i "Is that even a question?"
    i "Girls are messed up, Sensei."
    i "Just look at me."

        i "Me...and the rest of them...we’re all at that age where everything is just a big fucking project."
    else:
        s "Wow, yeah. You do look pretty messed up."
        i "I know. Like, why is my hair green? No one else has green hair."
        i "I was a mistake."

    scene iointro16
    with dissolve

    i "And I love projects, don’t get me wrong."
    i "I've built so many things."
    i "But sometimes, you can just take one look at something and know that it’s beyond fixing."

    scene iointro17
    with dissolve

    i "Getting to know people means getting to know what ails them."
    i "Which means trying to help them fix it."
    i "Which means {i}figuring out{/i} how to fix it."
    i "Then, before long, you’re spending more time on someone else than yourself."
    i "How many friends does a normal [teenage]girl have?"
    i "Four? Five?"
    s "Probably a lot more, to be honest."
    i "Ugh. That’s even worse."
    i "The more people you know, the more burdens you're forced to carry."
    i "But some people have {i}big{/i} frickin’ burdens, you know?"
    i "So maybe you can say that I’m afraid of being weighed down, or even that I'm afraid I’d weigh somebody {i}else{/i} down-"
    i "But the fact of the matter is, I think it’s easier to just stay away from people like that."
    i "I’ll surround myself with projects that won’t judge me or stab me in the back if I can’t do anything about them."

    scene iointro18
    with dissolve

    i "Or maybe I’ll just waste away my days with someone like you- who will sit there like a big old sponge and soak up all of my complaints."

    "The walls crumble once more."

    i "So, can we go get breakfast now?"
    s "Before that...I want to point out a little hypocrisy in your logic, Io."

    scene iointro19
    with dissolve

    i "Which part?"
    s "Your key complaint about girls is that they’re all projects. But don’t you think you’re making yourself sound like a bit of a project, too?"
    i "Oh, I’m like ten projects. I know that."
    i "It’s why I gave you that warning about how you might not like me once you get to know me."
    s "And if that’s true?...And I don’t come to like you once I figure you out?"
    i "You can throw me away."
    i "I’ll probably cry for a day or two. Maybe a week. But I’ll get over it."
    i "Worse things have happened to me."
    i "I just have a good feeling about the two of us."

    scene iointro20
    with dissolve

    if bonus == True:
        i "But there’s a good chance that feeling is just hormones."
    else:
        i "But there's a good chance that feeling is just all of the sugar packets I ate on the way here today catching up to me."

    i "And there’s a good chance that I’m already well beyond repair."
    i "But, in the event I’m not-"
    i "Do you want to try?"
    i "Do you want to keep getting to know me even after I’ve done nothing but say things that would scare a normal person away the last few days?"
    i "Cause I think...if you turn me down now, I can manage to not get hurt."
    i "There’s still a little bit of the wall left."

    "I find myself thinking this a lot but-"

    if bonus == True:
        "Teenagers really are exhausting."
    else:
        "Io is a huge fucking bitch."

    "How do you even develop a perspective like Io’s this early on in life?"
    "It’s only her first year in [high_school] and she’s already acting like she’s given up on associating with anyone for the rest of eternity."
    "Where does she expect to go?"

    scene iointro21
    with dissolve

    i "…"

    "And why...do I want to go with her?"

    s "Of course I still want to get to know you."
    s "I can’t let you just {i}only{/i} have Uta for the rest of your [high_school] career."
    s "Maybe I can even get you to add a few more of the girls into the mix. Hiding from them forever isn’t going to do you any favors."
    i "I’ve got a lot of baggage, Sensei...You’re opening a real can of worms here."
    s "Are you really trying to talk me out of this while looking like {i}that{/i}?"
    i "How do I look? I can’t see my face."
    s "I don’t know. Desperate?"
    i "Desperate?..."

    scene iointro22
    with dissolve

    i "Yeah..."
    i "That might not be too far off."
    i "You’re a real weirdo, Sensei."
    i "I thought my “Throw everything at him and pray something sticks” strategy was going to backfire for sure, but..."
    i "You don't seem scared of me at all."
    s "Let’s just say I’ve gotten pretty good at handling girls with issues over the last few months."
    i "Well, please handle mine gently if you’re going to handle them at all."
    i "I’m a lot more delicate than I let on..."
    i "So please..."
    i "Don't let me break."

    "One thing I don’t think Io realizes is that, after a few short conversations-"
    "She already feels more delicate than almost anyone I've ever met."
    "But her self-perception is clearly all out of sorts."
    "It’s strange how someone so self-centered can be so unaware of who they are or how they appear to others."
    "You’d think that focusing everything around your own interests or disinterests would help you avoid that."
    "But I guess, in some rare cases-"
    "That exact mindset can warp you."
    "Io Ichimonji does not exist."
    "She has already lost herself."
    "And, I can’t say this for sure right now-"
    "But I’m pretty sure that whoever this girl is-"
    "Needs my help finding her."

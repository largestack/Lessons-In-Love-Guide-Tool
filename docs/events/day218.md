    "It’s just before nightfall and I find myself headed to the mall with Ami and Maya."
    "It isn’t often that the three of us do anything without Ayane, so the air feels a little stranger than normal."
    "Granted, it isn’t often that Maya agrees to a plan with me involved in any form, so the entire foundation of this trip is a little out of the ordinary."

    a "Sensei! What’s my spending limit for today?!"

    "I reach into my pocket and pull out...absolutely nothing."
    "I have no cash."

    s "Zero Yen."
    a "Zero Yen?!"
    a "That’s even less than when you only gave me 1,000!"
    s "Yes, that is how numbers work."
    a "Just give me your credit card. I checked your bank info online and it says you’re nowhere near your spending limit."
    s "How did you access my bank information?"
    a "Easy. I know your email from the[school] messageboard and your password for the banking website was {i}Boobies123{/i}."
    m "..."
    s "I am a simple man. Don’t judge."
    m "You’re disgusting..."

    scene black
    with dissolve

    "Now, you’re probably wondering why I would have made something as childish as “Boobies123” my password."
    "And I have a perfectly reasonable explanation for that."
    "When I first woke up in Kumon-mi, I had a remarkably difficult time trying to access important things like my email account and bank information."
    "So, after some hacker-level account recovery troubleshooting (Which really just involved answering simple questions like “What is your [niece]’s name?”) I was able to get back into everything."
    "Then, being fed up with Internet stuff and just wanting to end the process, I changed all of my passwords to the first thing that came to mind."
    "Hence- “Boobies123.”"
    "…"
    "Shut up. At least I’m open about my interests."

    a "Shopping trip...start!"
    m "Hooray for spending money I don’t have."

    scene green2
    with dissolve

    a "Thanks for letting me borrow your credit card, Sensei. I’ll be sure to make it up to you when I get rich off of becoming a super-popular maid."
    m "I still can’t believe you are stooping to Uta’s level just for some extra spending money."
    a "Don’t listen to Maya. She’s just jealous because she needs to live off of her savings and is too lazy to get a job and make any money of her own."

    if bonus == True:
        s "How is your savings account enough to live off of at your age?"
    else:
        m "You just wait until my firm is open, Ami. You'll be sorry."

    scene green3
    with dissolve

    m "I’m good at rationing my money. "
    m "My main strategy is choosing quantity over quality and eating large amounts of mediocre food that will last me two or three days at a time in the form of leftovers."
    s "Well, that’s not a {i}bad{/i} idea...but it doesn’t sound very fulfilling."
    m "We can’t all have a girl who cooks and cleans for us every morning."
    a "Sensei, can Maya move in so she can eat with us and won’t have to ration her savings anymore?"
    s "Are you asking me to support Maya as if she were my child?"
    m "Ew. Don’t even joke about that."
    a "Is that a yes?"
    s "What? No. Not even close."
    m "For once, I am actually thankful for how horrible of a person you are."
    s "You’re welcome, Maya."

    scene green4
    with dissolve

    a "Oh well. Can’t say I didn’t expect you to say that."

    "Ami and Maya begin to look around the mall, probably figuring out which stores they want to head to first."
    "Just like they said yesterday, the mall is actually a bit more crowded than normal."
    "I guess even the lack of men around doesn’t make much of a dent in people shopping for those who are important to them."
    "It’s just weird to me that there are so many people around here that actually {i}have{/i} someone important to them in the first place."
    "It’s kind of a bitch finding companionship in general, let alone companionship with someone of the same sex."

    if bonus == True:
        "It’s just one of several reasons I surround myself with cute girls instead of other mysterious, glasses-wearing guys."
        "Why devote yourself to anything you wouldn’t also have sex with?"
        "That’s just how I look at it."

    scene green5
    with dissolve

    a "Huh..."
    a "Kinda weird they don’t have any Christmas decorations up yet."
    a "The mall normally has lights up around this time of year. Wonder if they’re just...too busy to hang ‘em up or something?"
    s "Don’t see how it makes much of a difference."
    a "Don’t say that to Ayane. She’ll hit you. That girl’s a holiday-aholic."
    s "That’s not even a thing."

    scene green6
    with dissolve

    a "So, what’s {i}your{/i} gameplan, Sensei? "
    a "Are you gonna come with us into all of the stores and watch us try on cute winter stuff? Or are you going to go abduct another little girl and force her to wear a dog mask?"

    if bonus == False:
        s "Okay, first off, it was not an abduction. I was being a nice person. And secondly-"

    s "She had an immuno-deficiency disorder..."
    a "...And that’s supposed to explain the dog mask?"

    scene green7
    with dissolve

    m "Poor girl never even had a chance. She’s in a better place now."
    s "She’s still alive..."
    m "Only because Ami and I showed up. Who knows where you would have taken her if we hadn’t?"

    if bonus == True:
        a "Yup-yup! If you’re into dog masks, you know I wouldn’t mind-"
        s "I’m going to stop you right there just to clarify that I am very much not {i}into{/i} dog masks. "
        s "Please preserve your mostly-innocent image and don’t offer to accommodate strange fetishes like that."
        a "Okay! I’m already kind of a fetish character in the first place, so I can see how doing more stuff like that might be over the top."
    else:
        s "Probably to the candy store because she is a good girl and deserves to be spoiled on occasion."
        a "I have always wanted to be a good girl, but it is hard when I also secretly kill people."

    scene green8
    with dissolve

    m "Are you really just going to openly admit that?"
    a "Admit what? I haven’t said anything."
    m "Please, for the love of the god I don’t believe in, do not turn into your [uncle]."
    s "Maya, do you need to borrow my credit card as well?"

    scene green9
    with dissolve

    m "Wait, what?"
    m "Is that an actual offer or are you actually insensitive enough to joke about a girl’s financial situation?"
    s "It’s an actual offer. "
    s "If Ami’s going to go off and buy stuff for herself, I don’t see the harm in you getting a thing or two as well."
    m "Oh."
    m "Well uhh, thanks? "
    m "I’m okay, though. I’m not like, poor or anything. It’s fine as long as I only buy new clothes every few seasons."
    a "There you have it, Sensei. Does this mean I can spend extra since Maya won’t be using your card?"
    s "Not at all. Please try to stay under 1,000 Yen total."

    scene green10
    with dissolve

    a "I hate you and your stupid 1,000 Yen limit! I’m gonna go spend a billion Yen on stuff I don’t even need now!"
    a "Come on, Maya!"

    scene green11
    with dissolve

    "Ami and Maya storm off and I’m suddenly left on my own without ever even having the chance to tell them I planned on coming."
    "It is what it is, though. I should probably buy some winter clothes myself if it’s actually going to start getting cold around here."

    scene black
    with dissolve

    "It’s been almost scorching every day since I was reincarnated."
    "For a while, I may have even thought that things were just going to stay that way forever."
    "But I guess a little change is good every now and then."

    scene green12
    with dissolve

    "I wind up instinctively heading over to the store Chika works at to see if she’s in today."
    "Of course, it’s a Friday and[school] only ended a few hours ago, so she’s nowhere to be found. "
    "It isn’t long before an employee I’ve never seen comes over to me and asks if I need help with anything."

    nce "Good afternoon, Sir. Are you looking for anything in particular today?"
    s "Yes, actually. How about a tan blonde with a ponytail and an affinity for pink?"
    nce "Ponytail?..."
    nce "Is this...a prank?"
    nce "Do I need to call security?"
    s "No...I was just joking."
    s "Can you point me to where you keep all of your winter clothing? I’m thinking it’s time for a change in my life."
    nce "I’d love to!"
    nce "Unfortunately...most of our winter stock has yet to arrive."
    nce "All we have for men are slightly thicker shirts and-"
    s "Good enough for me."
    nce "Really?"
    s "I’m not really that into fashion anyway and that sounds cheaper than anything else I’d find here."
    nce "Oh...Well, okay then. Right this way, I suppose."

    scene black
    with dissolve

    "The employee leads me to a section composed entirely of blank T-shirts. "
    "Really wanting to mix things up, I go with grey {i}and{/i} white instead of just white and prepare to shock my students when they see me in my new casual attire."
    "………"
    "……"
    "…"

    scene green13
    with dissolve2

    s "Oh?"

    "I stop myself on the way out of the store after purchasing a few new shirts and find two green scarves wrapped neatly around a pair of mannequins."

    s "…"
    s "I feel compelled to buy these for some reason."
    nce "Looking for a gift now, Sir?"

    "The same employee from before sneaks up behind me and begins trying to sell me the scarves."
    "I am weak to upselling. "
    "This is going to end poorly."

    nce "These actually just came in this morning."
    nce "It was so strange as well. We never ordered anything like these."
    nce "But it’s not like I was about to just let them go to waste so...voila. "
    s "So you’re selling things you never even ordered? How do you know how they should be priced?"
    nce "Oh, I have no idea. I just guessed."
    nce "If you act now, I’ll let you have both for just 4,000 Yen. My regional manager is on the way here anyway so I was actually just about to take them down and hide them."
    s "So I’m basically the only chance you have of selling these?"
    nce "You are! And-"
    s "I’ll give you 2,000 Yen."
    nce "...That’s half of the asking price."
    s "There is no asking price. This isn't even an item you're supposed to carry."
    s "2,000 Yen or I walk."
    nce "Fine...I guess this is my fault for revealing my secrets to you in the first place."
    s "Don’t beat yourself up over it. I rarely ever buy things for other people to begin with."
    s "This is a major victory for you."
    nce "Sure...Right this way, Sir."

    scene black
    with dissolve

    "Once again, I find myself pulling out my wallet and having to use the same backup credit card I used when purchasing my shirts due to Ami having the normal one."
    "Then, before I know it, I’m back in the hallway carrying multiple bags, hoping to find the two girls I came here with."
    "………"
    "……"
    "…"

    a "Oh! Sensei!"

    scene green14
    with dissolve

    "Ami comes running over to me, dropping a few bags of clothes she bought for herself at her feet."
    "Maya shows up seconds later, but with only one bag as opposed to Ami’s three."
    "At least I know she’d be more financially responsible if I {i}were{/i} to ever adopt her."

    a "Heya! We’re basically done here. "
    a "We’ve just gotta stop by a few other stores to get some stuff like boots and gloves and-"

    scene green15
    with dissolve

    a "Hey, whatcha got there?"
    a "Did you actually buy yourself something for once?"
    s "I did. I am now prepared for the cold."
    m "Hooray. One less thing for me to worry about."
    s "...And I {i}also{/i} got Maya here a present."

    scene green16
    with dissolve

    m "Wait, for real?"
    m "Why?"
    s "I just felt like being nice."
    m "…"
    m "Are you sure?"
    s "I wouldn’t have bought it if I wasn’t."
    m "Well...thank you."
    m "Can I see what it is?"
    s "Sure. Go right ahead."

    scene green17
    with dissolve

    "I hand Maya a bright green bag and she walks several steps away to check what’s inside. "
    "Obviously, it’s nothing to be excited about, so I’m sure she’ll be back to her typical, unwavering self in a few seconds."

    a "Hey! What’s the big idea, mister?! "
    a "How come Maya gets a present and I don’t?!"
    s "Oh, did I forget to say I got you one as well?"
    s "Here."

    scene green18
    with dissolve

    a "Ah! Present! What is it?! What is it?!"

    "Ami quickly snatches the bag out of my hands and looks inside of it."

    s "It’s just a scarf. I’m not sure if you bought one yet so, if you did, feel free to take this one ba-"
    s "Actually, never mind. I don’t think this is returnable."
    a "It’s perfect! All the stuff I bought earlier was green, too!"
    s "Maya’s is just a little bit brighter. "
    s "I know you two planned on matching, so I hope this much is okay."
    a "It’s super okay! I love it!"

    s "Yeah, I figured she'd react that way. You can just have hers as well, I guess."
    a "Does she really hate it that much?"

    "She picks up the bag and holds it tightly against her chest for a few seconds."
    "She breathes in and shakes her head as if to wash away any semblance of uneasiness that crept onto her face over the last several minutes."
    "The bell around her neck jingles as she does so."
    "And then-"
    "She lowers her arms and goes back to being a normal [teenage]girl."

    m "Ahem."

    m "There were no additional steps between any of those three things."
    a "Uhh...there were a bunch of additional steps."
    a "But I know how much you hate looking weak so we can just pretend those other steps never happened, I guess."
    m "What other steps? I have no idea what you’re referring to."
    m "But that aside, do you like your present as well?"

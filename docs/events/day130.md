    "Okay, so, before you ask: Yes, this is a bathhouse."
    "And no, I have not been here before."
    "Hell, I didn’t even realize Kumon-mi had a bathhouse until approximately half an hour ago when I found out our water had been shut off for some reason."
    "And given that it’s already the middle of the night and that the water company is closed, the {i}four{/i} of us were left with no other option but to come here."
    "Yes, that’s right. I said {i}four{/i} of us."
    "Maya and Ayane were planning on staying the night as well."
    "And before you go getting all excited about what this could possibly mean, allow me to break your heart."

    if bonus == True:
        "This is not a co-ed bathhouse...meaning I need to bathe alone while the other three do whatever it is girls do when they’re in the bath together."
        "Which is probably bathe."
        "But the more exciting side of me likes to believe it’s something else. "
        "I guess on one hand, though, it {i}is{/i} kind of beneficial to be in here alone."

        if amifingered == True:
            "Having both Ami {i}and{/i} Ayane in the same bath as me might be problematic for a number of reasons."
            "Would I like to have that happen regardless of any potential issues that might arise? Absolutely."
            "But I guess being apart from them is the safer option after all."

        else:
            "Having Ayane in the same bath as me might be a bit of an issue when it comes to hiding the, uhh, {i}nature{/i} of our relationship from Ami and Maya."
            "Sure, I’m positive that they’re well aware of {i}her{/i} feelings by now, but I doubt they’d want to be around when she attempts to capitalize on them."
    else:
        "None of us have any idea when the water is coming back on."

    scene bathmale2
    with dissolve

    "I take my clothes off and move through the door to find an exceedingly large open-air bath."
    "And, as expected, there are no other men in sight."
    "This is a good thing."
    "Don’t get me wrong, I’m not afraid of other men or anything like that- I just prefer when the bath isn’t overcrowded with penises."

    scene bathmale3
    with fade

    "I step into the water and immediately sit down."
    "The hot summer air mixed with the heat of the bath is actually somewhat comforting, in a way."
    "You’d think that two different levels of extreme heat would be enough to exhaust you but, for some reason, that doesn’t seem to be the case."

    if bonus == True:
        "I sigh to myself as my body temperature rises and am suddenly stricken with an idea that only the protagonist of an erotic game would have."
    else:
        "I sigh to myself as my body temperature rises and am suddenly stricken with an idea that only the protagonist of a dating sim would have."

    s "I can hear the girls from here..."

    play sound "water1.mp3"

    "In addition to the lack of penises, the lack of noise creates a much easier atmosphere to eavesdrop in."
    "I hush my breathing and direct my full attention to what wonders must lie on the opposite side of this bamboo fence..."

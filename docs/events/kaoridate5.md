    k "Oh, Friend! Thank you for pressing the buttons required to make my voice appear through your telephone."
    s "You’re welcome."
    s "What are you up to?"
    k "I am wandering around the area surrounding my home with a different friend!"
    s "A different friend? You managed to make another?"
    k "I purchased this friend with real, human money! "
    s "You...bought a friend?"
    k "Yes! Come see! I am near the location where we ate the large wheel of cheese and dough together."
    s "Oh. Okay. That’s not that far from my place."
    s "I’ll head over now."

    "Well, at least she’s trying."
    "I can’t imagine Kaori having {i}actually{/i} purchased a friend but, she’s been rather calm concerning human trafficking in the past, so I guess it’s not completely out of the question."
    "I’ll just have to wait and see what she meant."
    "………"
    "……"

    "I arrive in the residential district neighboring my own to find a rather joyful looking Kaori, all alone and minding her business near the waterway."
    "She runs over to me the second she sees me and just stares at me without saying anything."
    "It’s weird. But she has a cute smile so I let her do her thing and just...stare for a little while as I try to think of something to talk about."

    k "Today is a good, human day. "
    k "I was released from work early, I drank four cups of hot bean water, {i}and{/i} I got to rub a large, human cock for almost a whole hour!"
    s "…"
    s "Excuse me, what?"
    k "Hm? Which part are you confused about?"
    s "Which part do you think I’m confused about?"
    k "If you are questioning why I was released from work early it is because business was slow! "
    k "Which provided more time to rub the cock!"
    s "God I hope this is just a misunderstanding. "

    k "What is wrong, Friend? "
    k "Would you also like to rub the cock?"
    k "I can show you all the best ways."
    s "This...{i}cock{/i}. Does it belong to your friend?"
    k "That is a strange combination of words. The cock {i}is{/i} my friend."
    k "Are you jealous that you do not have a huge cock as well?"
    s "I can assure you that I-"
    ahc "BACAWK!"
    s "…"
    k "What is wrong?"
    s "Did you hear that?"
    k "All I heard was the cock."

    scene kaorishugecock3

    "I look down to find a “Large human cock” at my feet, squawking at cars as they pass by."

    s "I should have foreseen this."
    k "This is the cock that saved your life!"
    ahc "BACAWK (Sup, dude?)"

    "Do I have some secret power that allows me to understand animals?"
    "Also, is this Todd’s older relative or something? It’s basically just a super-sized version of him."
    "He’s so big that he’s almost up to Kaori’s waist. It’s kind of intimidating, to tell the truth."

    scene kaorishugecock4
    with dissolve

    k "I love this cock!"
    s "Kaori, please stop."
    s "Also, stop adding the word “Human” to places it doesn’t belong. I gravely misinterpreted what was happening before I showed up today."

    scene kaorishugecock5
    with dissolve

    k "What did I do incorrectly?"
    k "Is this not a cock after all? Because {i}I{/i} thought it was a chicken."
    k "But when I purchased it from the man at the Chinese restaurant, he continuously referred to it as a cock."
    k "He said “cock” so many times that I began to question if there were other animals I was also confused about."
    k "Please tell me what I am to call this creature, Friend."
    s "Chicken is fine. Cock is another word that works as well but...it also has a different meaning that’s very easy to misinterpret when you say things like, “I love this cock.”"

    scene kaorishugecock6
    with dissolve

    k "Different meaning?"
    k "What else does that word mean?"
    s "It’s slang for “penis.”"
    k "…"
    s "…"
    ahc "…"

    scene kaorishugecock7
    with dissolve

    k "Cock means...penis?..."
    k "As in...the male meat-stick?"
    k "And I...said all of those things about...loving it..."
    k "In the middle of a busy section of the...area I live in..."

    scene kaorishugecock8
    with hpunch

    k "And you allowed me to say these things?!"
    s "If it were up to me, I wouldn’t allow you to say things like “male meat-stick” either but here we are."
    k "John! Attack!"
    john "BACAWK! (Please forgive my master. She is a very confused girl.)"
    s "Got it. Thanks for not being as uptight as the other birds, John."
    john "BACAWK! (Any time, dude.)"
    k "Why are you communicating with my co...CHICKEN as if you are able to understand it?!"
    k "Please do not tell me you are fluent in chickenspeak as well as humanspeak, Friend!"
    s "I think I am but I’ve only really known about this power for a few minutes now."

    scene kaorishugecock9
    with dissolve

    k "Well...either way...I am relieved to know that I was able to at least save {i}one{/i} of the chickens from the secret chicken sanctuary."
    s "You mean the back alley?"
    k "Yes. The chicken sanctuary."
    s "It’s not really a sanctuary if that’s where the chickens were being stored before being slaughtered."
    john "BACAWK! (Wait, slaughtered?...But those other chickens were...)"
    s "My mistake, John. I’m sure they’re fine."
    john "BACAWK! (Oh. Cool. Was a little worried for a second there.)"

    "That’s good. It appears that all of those things I’ve heard about chickens not being the brightest are actually true after all."

    k "Since I was only able to obtain a single chicken, I decided to choose the one with a proven track record of helping others."
    k "I will defend this chicken with my life."
    k "I will die for it if the need arises."
    s "I can’t imagine that need ever arising, so I think you’ll be okay."
    s "It’s sweet of you to have chosen that chicken, but I’m surprised you were only able to afford one."
    s "Chickens are normally pretty cheap."

    scene kaorishugecock10
    with dissolve

    k "Are they?"
    k "I am not familiar with the chicken market so it is possible the chicken-killing-food-man took advantage of me."
    s "Does your place have room for him, though? He’s kind of large for a chicken."
    s "I think he’s even bigger than he was when he “rescued” me."
    k "He is. But I have been feeding him hamburgers in an effort to make him more like you."
    s "Okay well, first off, that’s adorable."
    s "Secondly, you probably shouldn’t feed a chicken hamburgers."
    john "BACAWK! (Bruh)"
    s "This is for your own good, John."

    scene kaorishugecock11
    with dissolve

    k "I see. Perhaps it is best to follow the chicken manual after all."
    s "There’s a...chicken manual?"

    "Kaori begins to retreat toward the bushes behind her and John follows suit, leaving me with the option of either bailing or following the two of them who have been attracting the eyes of nearly everyone around us."
    "And while I am no stranger to being seen with a huge cock, I will say that I feel slightly uncomfortable in this specific scenario."

    scene kaorishugecock12
    with dissolve

    "I take a seat next to Kaori and John manages to hop into the space between us."
    "He’s surprisingly agile for a gigantic chicken and I think he might even be able to give Todd a run for his money."
    "Also, why do I know the names of multiple chickens all of a sudden?"
    "What is happening to my life?"

    k "Have you ever saved a life, Friend?"
    s "Me? Not at all. We can’t {i}all{/i} be Kaori."
    s "You did a good thing. Even if that good thing probably cost like thirty or forty people dinner."
    k "While it is true that some may have their stomachs yell “Grrrrr” due to lack of chicken, the smiles John can gift to others will make up for it."
    s "You can’t survive off of just smiles, though."
    k "No but you can not survive with just food either!"
    k "Humans must combine nutrients and emotions to make their lives worth living!"
    k "Too much of one thing is bad. Except if that one thing is chickens."

    scene kaorishugecock13
    with dissolve

    k "I would still like to save more. But I should be happy with a cock this special."
    s "You did it again."

    scene kaorishugecock14

    k "Did what?"
    s "Said cock instead of chicken."

    scene kaorishugecock15

    k "S-Stop turning it into a dirty word! You know what I am speaking of!"
    k "I accept corrections of my normal speech but not when they are going to make my face get hot and my chest grow tight!"
    k "John, attack!"
    john "BACAWK! (But I’m so tired...)"
    s "Fine, fine. Call him whatever you want."
    s "I’m just glad you finally have someone to absorb all of that love you have to give."
    s "You’ve been trying to find a pet ever since I met you."
    s "And even though this one isn’t exactly normal...I’m sure it’ll give you all of those smiles that you apparently need to keep your human body healthy."

    scene kaorishugecock16
    with dissolve

    k "Yes, yes. I can feel my strength returning with each passing day."
    k "Soon, I will be able to master things like jumping the rope or treading the mill."
    s "Or, you could just go to the gym and practice those things like most other people who want to master them."
    k "The gyms in this area do not appreciate my crest."
    s "You mean your tattoo?"
    k "I do. Too many people either scream or ask to touch it."
    k "You are one of the few who has yet to do either. Which is one of the hundred and thirteen reasons we make good friends."
    k "There are likely more reasons but I have yet to write them down."
    s "Does...that mean you’ve physically written down over a hundred reasons already?"

    scene kaorishugecock17
    with dissolve

    k "Of course I have."
    k "Is that not common practice for human friends?"
    s "It’s really not."
    k "Oh."
    k "Well, I’m going to keep writing them down anyway since looking at them before I go to sleep makes me smile."
    s "Can I read them?"
    k "…"
    s "…"
    s "Kaori?"
    k "I wanted to say yes but the thought of you seeing the things I wrote suddenly makes me feel even stranger than the meat-sticks did."
    s "That’s fine. I don’t need to see them right away."
    s "I would appreciate it if I got to before you hit a thousand reasons, though."
    s "I can’t imagine being okay with reading any more than that."

    "But, to be fair, I don’t even think it’s possible to come up with that many reasons."
    "Hell, I’m impressed she was able to think up more than like, five."

    scene kaorishugecock18
    with dissolve

    k "I understand!"
    k "It is possible these strange feelings inside of me are the result of what humans call “puberty” as well."
    k "That seemed to be the popular result when I researched the way I was feeling on SpiderwebMD."
    s "That’s not a thing."
    k "Yes it is."
    s "Also, you’re too old for puberty. You’re what, 22?"
    k "In human years, yes. But 154 in dog years."
    k "Probably 155 now."
    k "Why is it that dogs move through space and time quicker than humans do, Friend?"
    k "Do you think they could bestow their knowledge unto us?"
    k "You seem to have the ability to speak with John, so perhaps you could speak to a dog as well?"
    k "If you speak to a dog, could you also inform him that I love him?"
    s "You haven’t even seen this fictional future-dog yet."
    k "I have not. But I love all dogs so I am sure I will love whichever one reveals the secrets of the universe to you."
    s "Sounds good, Kaori."
    s "I’ll make sure to include that in the conversation I will definitely have with a dog in the near future."

    "Kaori and I (And I guess John) continue to chat for a while longer and eventually buy another pizza from that shop we’ve been to before."
    "Kaori only eats one slice and then feeds the rest to the chicken- something I would not advise actual chicken-owners to do."
    "Eventually, it comes time for me to leave and the two (Or three) of us part ways and head back to our respective homes."
    "I take a quick shower to get any residual farm-animal stench off of me before I put some fresh clothes on and head out the door..."

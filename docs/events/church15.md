    "The trip to Yasu’s church feels a little different in the summer."
    "Along with the cold comes a terrifying silence that unsettles my stomach with every sacrilegious step toward the sanctuary."
    "But the heat of this new season masks those sounds with a soundtrack of its own."
    "The silence has died. And in its place rests a barrage of endless insectual (A made up word not to be confused with “incestual” that pertains to the quality of being a [or being created by an] insect) melodies-"
    "The creatures sing to me as if I am one of them. "
    "They sing to me as if to welcome me home."

    "And in turn, I bend my legs backward and turn them into makeshift coils, springing into the sky like the world’s largest camel cricket and coming closer to the moon than necessary."
    "Its light reminds me of who I am and where I’ve been."
    "Its light reminds me of why I’m here and what I am to do next."
    "And so I take my coiled legs and unfurl them into the shapes I have grown familiar with."
    "Triangle. Circle. Triangle."
    "None of which you understand."
    "But to me, it makes perfect sense."
    "To me, this all makes perfect sense."
    "If it didn’t, I wouldn’t find myself amidst this INSECTUAL chorus with my mind half drowned in a bathtub full of honey while the rest figures out a way to float atop it."
    "I come close enough to the sky that I can smell the clouds, but the putrid stench of the cumulocirrus outlines of all of the things I have lost is enough to bring me back to the ground."

    "It is enough to make me seek salvation in a way much different than I am meant to."
    "It is enough to have me curl my fingers around the handle of the door to a building in a city that houses a girl who I will one day fill with my light."
    "It is enough to remind me that I have always hated the summer."
    "And that I will continue to hate it until the day I die once more."

    "When I step inside, I am greeted by the sight of the girl I came to see electing to spend time with a colony of inanimate rabbits rather than someone actually capable of listening to her perpetual psychobabble."
    "Perhaps it is because they are incapable of running away like the rest of us do."
    "Or perhaps it is because somewhere, buried beneath all of the fluff and feathers or whatever it is they stuff inside of creatures like them is something that {i}can{/i} hear."
    "Perhaps they are creatures who {i}can{/i} feel."
    "I mean, we’re all stuffed with something, aren’t we?"
    "How is what’s inside of {i}us{/i} any better when {i}we’re{/i} the ones who will expire while they live on forever?"
    "Granted, this is all just hopeful conjecture bent into shapes that will make the girl I came to see look less damaged under the glow of the church lights."
    "Triangle. Circle. Triangle."
    "I can hear a god forming beneath the stone floor."

    ya "What’s wrong, Penemue?"
    ya "You’ve barely touched your eggs."
    ya "If you don’t clear your plate, you won’t be able to come to the white room with us."
    ya "That would be a terrible shame, don’t you agree?"
    ya "And you, Wormwood. You’ve had four whole glasses of tea today. Don’t you think that may be a little much?"
    ya "If you drink any more, you’re certain to get a tummy ache. And I’m afraid I am fresh out of dried papaya to help fix you."
    cre "..."
    ya "..."
    ya "Is that so? You brought your own?"
    ya "My, since when are you so responsible? "
    ya "Penemue could learn a thing or two from you."
    s "..."

    "I think about calling out to Yasu and putting an end to whatever weird charade this is but, at the same time, I can’t help but be fascinated by the way she speaks to them."
    "It’s different than the way she communicates with people- the way she communicates with {i}me.{/i}"
    "And, for lack of a better term (And I don’t mean to sound insulting), it makes her feel...human."
    "Much like the way her sudden interest in solo karaoke did at the Christmas party but, this time around, things actually seem to be a little {i}more{/i} depressing."
    "Though, that may just be because Touka isn’t here to dampen her infinite loneliness this time and that, instead, Yasu has taken to quelling that issue in a new way. One that-"

    ya "How long are you going to stand there for, Sensei?"
    ya "Haven’t you come to join the tea party?"
    s "...I didn’t realize you knew I was here."

    ya "The cathedral doors are rather loud. And Wormwood here hates the sound of insects that floods the room each time the doors are opened."
    ya "Please, sit down with us. The festivities are just getting started...and they have been looking forward to meeting you."
    s "The...stuffed animals have been looking forward to meeting me?"

    scene teaparty3
    with dissolve

    ya "Is that what you see?"
    s "Well...that’s what they are. So, yes."
    s "Also, what festivities? Is there actually some kind of reason for this...weird cathedral tea party thing?"

    scene teaparty4
    with dissolve

    ya "There is!"
    ya "It is our celebration of summer!"
    ya "A new coming of our humble god is upon us. And we have gathered here today to welcome Him and drink in His love!"
    ya "This tea was brewed with water fresh from the basement ceiling and leaves gathered from the alley behind the cathedral."
    ya "To become closer to God, we must partake in the pieces of Him. And in doing so, we will be granted safety, serenity, and forgiveness for the sins we have committed but have yet to realize."
    s "You gathered leaves from the alley and turned them into tea?"
    ya "Not just any tea, Sensei. Tea that brings us closer to Him. Don’t you want to try?"
    ya "Wormwood has already had four cups and he is very picky when it comes to fluids. I’m sure you’ll love it as well."
    s "I’m good, Yasu. Thanks."

    scene teaparty5
    with dissolve

    ya "At the very least, will you sit with us and partake in the rest of the celebration?"
    ya "Their feelings will be very hurt if you leave after coming all this way."
    s "Sure. But...just to reiterate, I am not drinking your weird ceiling water tea."

    "I move to the opposite side of the table and pull out the only chair not occupied by the lifeless body of a rabbit."
    "I wonder if this seat being empty means that Yasu anticipated me coming here and, if so...why?"
    "It’s not like I haven’t come here of my own volition in the past, but I’m far from being considered a regular at this point and...there was really no reason for her to believe I {i}would{/i} show up."

    scene teaparty6
    with dissolve2

    s "Yasu."
    ya "Yes?"
    s "You weren’t expecting me, were you?"
    ya "Of course I was."
    s "But...why?"
    ya "Because even if it is not yet apparent to you, your heart beats in tune with His."
    ya "You were always going to wind up here for the celebration whether or not you knew it."
    ya "Deep down inside, you love the summer. The same way we do."
    s "You mean you and the rabbits?"
    ya "I suppose, if that is what makes this easier for you to understand."
    s "I don’t think anything is going to make this easier to understand."
    ya "You are free to ask any questions you may have."
    ya "Penemue may not be in the brightest of moods today, but he is very knowledgeable when it comes to our reasons to {i}be.{/i}"
    ya "And Wormwood is a font of information when it comes to the history of our God."
    ya "There’s also Muriel...and Yomiel...and Zachariel...and many others hidden in the background who would be more than happy to hold your hand as you embark on your journey closer to us, Sensei."
    s "Again, I’m good. I’m just...here to hang out with you, really."
    ya "Hang out?"
    s "Yeah. You know...spend time together. As like, friends. Or...whatever we are."

    scene teaparty7
    with dissolve

    ya "Heheh..."
    ya "We are not friends, Sensei."
    s "You know, it really hurts when you, of all people, are the one saying that."
    ya "That isn’t to say that I don’t {i}want{/i} to be your friend. I would love that."
    ya "But I am entirely undeserving."
    ya "Besides...there’s something much more important that we have to do. Something that transcends the relationship of even lovers, let alone {i}friends.{/i}"
    s "Right. Fill the world with light or whatever."
    ya "If only it were that simple."
    ya "You see, one of my favorite things about summer is that His voice becomes much clearer."
    ya "Which means that my {i}purpose{/i} becomes much clearer in turn."
    s "And that purpose is?"

    ya "This is the last party we’ll be having for quite some time. And I’m sure you’ll have changed your mind by the time the next one comes around."
    ya "That is how He has envisioned it."
    ya "That is where things will go from here."

    "I knock on Futaba’s door and wait for her to answer."

    no "Whooooo is it?~"

    "But instead, I am greeted by Nodoka- a person I’ve yet to deal with since the Yumi incident. "
    "And while I wasn’t planning on reconciling with her tonight (Nor do I know if “reconciliation” would even be applicable here in the first place), leaving now seems kind of...out of the question."
    "I’ve knocked on this door enough by now that I’m sure Futaba would be able to pick mine out of {i}hundreds{/i} of other knocks."
    "And assuming Nodoka doesn’t have her tied up and nude right now, she’s probably expecting me to come inside and not just fake her out by announcing my presence and immediately running away."

    play sound "dooropen.mp3"

    "I sigh to myself as I open the door, knowing full well that the type of person I am disallows me from avoiding anyone- particularly girls I want to have sex with."
    "And even though Nodoka’s last showing was, in no way, something I respect or would have done myself, I still do {i}like{/i} her."
    "And Futaba must as well if she’s still letting her get that close."

    scene futabanodokadorm1
    with dissolve2

    "I guess the chances of Futaba knowing what {i}actually{/i} happened are rather slim, though, as I doubt she’d lend her shoulder to a sexual assailant."
    "To her, it just looked like Nodoka was attacked out of the blue."
    "But the blue in this case is just so deep and dark that it’s hard to really decipher what that means. And no one has the time to go digging for something that is already peeking out of the surface."
    "She found her own answer. And even though it is the wrong one, who would I be to take that from her when possessing it allows her to feel as comfortable as this?"
    "Because this is far more comfortable than she ever appeared under the weight of an aggressor. "

    no "Futaba, look. Papa is home."
    no "Do you think he brought any sweets for us to share? Or do you think perhaps we {i}are{/i} the sweets...and he has come to devour us whole?"
    f "I think that...the latter is probably closer to being true. I don’t know if I’d use the word “devour,” though..."
    no "Which one of us will you have first, Sensei? And what will become of the one who’s forced to watch?"
    s "I didn’t realize you’d be here as well, Nodoka. How are you feeling?"

    scene futabanodokadorm2
    with dissolve

    no "Why, I feel closer to Heaven than I’ve ever felt before. If you’d come any earlier, you may have even seen my childhood friend here performing {i}special{/i} services both for and {i}on{/i} me."
    s "Futaba, if you’ve been bisexual this whole time, you should have lent Rin a hand. Getting some of that pent-up energy out of her could have potentially saved her from a bad decision or two."

    scene futabanodokadorm3
    with dissolve

    f "I’m sorry to break it to you, but that’s...not what Nodoka was alluding to..."
    f "I just gave her a little massage. That’s all."
    no "Happy ending and all."
    f "It was just a normal ending. Please don’t listen to her."
    s "Well, I guess it’s good to see you’re both okay. I was a little worried that Nodoka may have lost some of her memories and that {i}you’d{/i} still be in pieces somehow blaming yourself for what happened."

    scene futabanodokadorm4
    with dissolve

    f "I mean...it’s kind of hard {i}not{/i} to. What other common ground do Yumi and Nodoka even share? It pretty much {i}has{/i} to be something involving me, doesn’t it?"
    s "Do you think Yumi would really go that far just to bully someone?"
    f "I..."

    scene futabanodokadorm5
    with dissolve

    no "Of course she would. People like that don’t need a reason for {i}anything{/i} they do. They act on impulse...{i}instinct.{/i} "
    no "And sometimes, those animalistic tendencies wind up showing the best of us. Wouldn’t you agree?"
    s "I’m not sure if I follow."
    no "Then perhaps a little question is in order?"
    no "If an animal is coated in its own blood with its innards splayed out across the forest floor, is {i}it{/i} the one deserving of the blame for its fate to be devoured?"
    no "Or do we shun the ravenous horde that feasts upon the flesh, converting the weak into sustenance? The sustenance into progression."
    s "Do you really think it’s accurate to be comparing yourself to a dying animal?"
    no "Silly Sensei. It appears you’ve gotten my little metaphor backwards."
    f "I don’t really...get any of this stuff about animals and predators, but..."
    f "I don’t think it would be {i}impossible{/i} for Yumi to do something like that..."

    scene futabanodokadorm6
    with dissolve

    f "What do you think, Sensei? You’ve been spending more time with Yumi lately, haven’t you? "
    f "Do you know something that may have...set her off? "

    scene futabanodokadorm7
    with dissolve

    no "Yes...{i}do you{/i} know of something like that, Sensei? Because it would have to be {i}pretty bad{/i} to warrant a beating like the one I received, wouldn’t it?"
    s "Yeah...I imagine it would. But I think you’d know a little better about what that could be than me, wouldn’t you?"
    no "Mmm...I don’t think so? I’m just as confused as you are."
    s "So you {i}haven’t{/i} gone out of your way to provoke her behind Futaba’s back and seek vengeance on her behalf?"

    scene futabanodokadorm8
    with dissolve

    f "You didn’t...actually do anything like that, did you?"
    no "Not that I can recall. But, if you’d like my two cents, I don’t think there’s {i}anything{/i} I could have done to that girl that could make up for all the pain she caused you."
    f "It’s true that Yumi hurt me...a lot...and that I’ve always been really afraid of her...but I wouldn’t want {i}her{/i} to suffer as well just because of that."
    no "Yes, because you’re a genuinely good person amidst a sea of evil ones. A person who would give up her own flotation device to save the life of the man who sunk the ship."
    no "How unfortunate it is that the best among us must suffer the most while the worst are revered for their efforts in bettering themselves. "
    no "What good is planting one tree in a forest you razed yourself?"

    scene futabanodokadorm9
    with dissolve

    no "Unfortunately, Sensei and I can’t relate to that as the two of {i}us{/i} have razed our share of forests as well. "
    f "I don’t...think either of you are anything like that. I can’t imagine you ever doing anything to purposely hurt someone."
    no "But if we did...if we {i}did{/i} hurt others in the same fashion Yumi hurt you...how would your thoughts of us change?"
    no "Would you still invite us into this room with open arms? Lend us your bosom when we long for something to cry into?"
    no "Or would you search for someone a little “better” to hand off your flotation device to?"

    scene futabanodokadorm10
    with dissolve

    no "All things considered, I’d like to remain floating with both of you as this shared company injects life back into this slowly rotting heart of mine. "
    f "Don’t say things like that about yourself, Nodoka...you know I don’t like that."
    no "Apologies, bestie. The day I do something to hurt you is the day I breathe my last."

    scene futabanodokadorm11
    with dissolve

    no "But I suppose I’ve overstayed my welcome tonight as there is a large man hovering over us who very much would like to revel in that bosom I spoke of just seconds ago."
    f "You know that...we don’t always just...{i}you know...{/i}"
    no "Oh, I know. But the fact that it happens at all fills me with a breed of jealousy I have a hard time finding the words to describe."
    no "And I also have some...{i}errands{/i} I must run."
    no "How lucky you are, Sensei. Being able to {i}take{/i} whatever you want without consequence while the rest of us struggle endlessly in pursuit of that same fruit."
    no "You’re truly a role model, you know? And I hope with all of my rotting heart to one day drink from the same overflowing chalice that rests in your hands."

    scene futabanodokadorm12
    with dissolve

    no "Goodnight, Futaba. And goodnight, Da- heh. "
    no "Goodnight, {i}Sensei.{/i}"
    no "Almost let my fantasies get the better of me there."

    play sound "dooropen.mp3"

    "Nodoka leaves the room and I wonder to myself why I continue to let this infected wound fester beneath a layer of adhesive instead of ripping the bandage off and medicating it."
    "But as the door closes and I turn back to Futaba, I remember that part of the reason is that I’m just too interested in how the wound feels when I poke it."
    "The other part is that I worry ripping the bandage off will just create a larger wound."

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "Nodoka knows too much. "
    "In fact, that’s {i}all{/i} Nodoka does when she’s not busy masterminding plans to strip the girls she dislikes down and offer them up to me like a cat dropping a dead mouse at the feet of its master."
    "I did not ask for this- but it is something I have now."
    "And until I find a way to properly dispose of it, I must continue feeding it and loving it and appreciating it."
    "For despite those that suffer due to the sharp cuts of her canines, I have only felt the opposite-"
    "A never ending influx of new experiences, each more pleasurable yet less believable than the last and only attainable through the deepest depths of my mind."
    "How she made it there, I don’t know."
    "But I am far too afraid to remove her."

    scene futabanodokadorm13
    with dissolve2

    "I take a seat on the bed and redirect my attention to Futaba, who shoots me a glance halfway between apologetic and relieved."
    "I return it with an exasperated sigh and we both silently agree that Nodoka, even when all she’s doing is resting her head on the shoulder of her friend, is very exhausting to be around."
    "But that’s fine...because Futaba is the complete inverse of that- and I struggle to think of a time when being around her did {i}not{/i} fill me with a sense of extreme comfort."
    "But it’s that exact thought that makes me question just how she found herself letting a virus like Nodoka in."
    "And I wonder if it is just one more example of her helping someone who should probably just sink stay afloat instead."

    s "Do you really trust her, Futaba?"

    scene futabanodokadorm14
    with dissolve

    f "Nodoka? Why wouldn’t I?"
    s "I don’t know. She doesn’t seem like she’s always...scheming to you?"

    scene futabanodokadorm15
    with dissolve

    f "Ah...that. Yeah, it does feel like she’s always up to something, doesn’t it?"
    f "Nodoka is...well, as I’m sure you’ve realized, a pretty big personality. But I don’t really think that it’s big in the wrong ways."
    f "There are other big personalities like...like Yumi for example. People who take over conversations and situations just by actively participating in them."
    f "And while Nodoka does make a lot of people uncomfortable...like, {i}very{/i} uncomfortable, I’ve never really seen her make someone feel {i}bad{/i} before."
    f "She’s...umm..."

    scene futabanodokadorm16
    with dissolve

    f "She’s...{i}protective.{/i} I think that’s the best word for it."
    f "She doesn’t connect with very many people, so when she actually {i}does{/i}, she’ll do everything she can think of to keep cultivating that relationship. That’s probably where the...scheming thing comes from."
    f "But...take me, for example. When she stood up for me in class and...when she became Yumi’s {i}new{/i} target...that wasn’t the first time she’s ever done something like that for me."
    f "She’s been sticking up for me for as long as I can remember...and I have nothing but good things to say about her."
    f "But I guess I can understand if she’s a little too much for some people."
    s "Then, to ask the same question she tried asking before...what if you found out she wasn’t actually like that?"

    scene futabanodokadorm17
    with dissolve

    f "You mean...if she actually {i}did{/i} try to get revenge for me behind my back?"
    s "Yeah...How would you feel about her then?"
    f "I’d feel...disappointed. Because she knows better than anyone that’s the exact opposite of what I’d want."
    f "But it would have to be something really bad to seriously impact my relationship with her because, even if it’s something I {i}didn’t{/i} want her to do, she did it because she cares about me."
    s "Are you sure that-"

    scene futabanodokadorm18
    with dissolve

    f "Absolutely."
    f "I’ve never been more sure of anything."
    f "Could personal interest be a factor as well? Of course. This is Nodoka we’re talking about. She’s even more of a narcissist than you are."

    scene futabanodokadorm17
    with dissolve

    f "But she’s also extremely kind..."
    f "She just doesn’t like when people know that."
    s "I’ll...believe that when I see it, I guess."
    f "That’s the thing, though, Sensei. She probably won’t ever {i}let{/i} you see it."
    f "Those “errands” she mentioned before leaving...what do you think they are?"
    f "What do you think she’s doing right now?"
    s "I don’t know. Probably something involving porn."

    scene futabanodokadorm18
    with dissolve

    f "She’s taking care of her mom."
    s "What? "
    f "Nodoka is constantly moving back and forth between the dorms and her home because her mom isn’t..."
    f "Well, she isn’t really able to function on her own. But that’s really all I feel comfortable telling you..."
    s "What happened to her?"

    scene futabanodokadorm19
    with dissolve

    f "I literally just told you that was all I feel comfortable telling you..."
    s "Sure. But I’ve made you feel uncomfortable plenty of times in the past and it’s never really backfired before. Also, I doubt Nodoka will tell me anything about this if I ask."
    f "Please don’t ask. I don’t really want her knowing that I told you. "
    f "I just didn’t want you thinking she was some kind of evil genius when she’s more of an...extremely eccentric, socially awkward genius who has trouble empathizing and...a dysfunctional moral compass."
    s "Huh..."

    scene futabanodokadorm18
    with dissolve

    f "Does knowing {i}that{/i} change your opinion of her?"
    s "I...have to think about it, I guess."
    f "That’s so strange, though. I really thought you liked Nodoka. At the very least, she seems to like you a lot."
    s "I do like Nodoka. I just have a harder time understanding her than...all of the non-Yasu girls, I guess. "

    "Plus, I watched her singlehandedly dismantle both the life and reputation of a girl I worked genuinely hard for and that...does not sit well with me."
    "Hearing that she’s an actual human being instead of a vengeance-robot does help a little in reshaping her inside of my mind, but...I don’t think she’ll be returning to her original form in there any time soon."

    f "I get what you’re saying. Sometimes, I think I’m the only person who {i}does{/i} understand Nodoka. "
    f "I had pretty much this same exact talk with Rin shortly after Nodoka moved into the dorms and I’m sure I’ll have it again with someone else too. I’m used to it."
    f "To be frank, there’s a ton of stuff about her I’m sure I’ll never understand. But I don’t think you need to understand everything about someone to figure out if they’re important to you or not."
    f "After all, there’s even more I don’t understand about {i}you{/i} and I lo-"

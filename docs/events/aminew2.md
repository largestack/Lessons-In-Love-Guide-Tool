    "She is a character in a video game that I have somehow found myself inside of. "
    "A game where the capabilities are about as limited as the amount of fingers on the hard stub of flesh at the end of your arm."
    "Limited by me and no one else. Limited by me because despite this world being one that is entirely mine and no one else’s, I still manage to do what is right sometimes."
    "Sure, I do plenty of things that are wrong as well, but I have yet to fiercely penetrate any unwilling vagina that has presented itself before me because, for some reason, I want to play this game correctly."
    "Perhaps it is because I think I will be rewarded for all of the good I do when it finally comes time for it to end."
    "Or perhaps it is because the sensation of an unwilling, dry flesh opening just isn’t anywhere close to the one that is ready to get fucked and covered in DIY girl juice."

    "Actually, they’re not really cloaked in black at all. They just {i}are{/i} black. But like, literally the color black and not the race. "

    s "Where Ami."
    a1 "Away! Away she goes in preparation!"
    a2 "Sad day! So very sad!"

    s "The marsh warbler lives off of a diet of insects and also occasionally eats things like spiders and snails."
    s "While most of its diet is plucked from vegetation, it sometimes snatches bugs out of thin air or off the ground when it is feeling less acrobatic."
    s "It is a medium sized warbler who mimics the calls of many other birds, hoping to lure them into its general vicinity so it can use its narrow, pointed beak to prod at their respective cloacae."
    s "There are estimated to be between 10 and 27 million marsh warblers in existence. Their eggs are not normally eaten by humans, but they could be if a human decided to eat them."

    "I wind up giving them an incorrect piece of mind, which is actually even better for me because it means that they will now be incapable of completing the puzzle that is my very existence."

    a1 "So many bird facts!"
    a2 "Warble warble warble!"

    "The figure on the right begins to gyrate different parts of his body at different intervals, creating a sort of jiggling effect that reminds me a little bit of Jell-O and causes me to get hungry."

    plant7 "Aight, man. You do you. I’m just sayin’ that if she comes home and finds your fuckin’ baby batter all over her socks, you’re gonna have some explaining to do."
    s "You are right. There is only one thing I can do at a time like this."

    "I pick up the sock and begin squeezing it to get the cum out, but I forget that it is a sock, so all of the cum is absorbed."

    s "Oh no."
    plant7 "Bro. Bro. Fuck. Okay, here’s what you’ve gotta do."
    s "I have made a horrible mistake."
    plant7 "No, bro, it’s okay. You’ve just gotta bury the sock inside of me."
    s "But what if you get pregnant? I can’t afford to take care of a sapling."
    plant7 "Bro, don’t worry. You think this is the first time you’ve buried a cum sock inside of me? I guarantee you there are at least like five more down there right now."
    s "Are you sure it is okay?"
    plant7 "Bro, {i}yes.{/i} Socks disappear all the fucking time. Where the hell you think they go?"
    s "I’ve never really thought about it."
    plant7 "Good. Stop thinking altogether."
    plant7 "Erase your mind and wipe the residual cum from a bad decision off of your hands. Life goes on."

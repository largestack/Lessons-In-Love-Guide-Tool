    sev "Do you wish to hold it all again?"

    sev "We are here under special guidance and even more special supervision. A fantastic show for you and you alone."
    sev "Free from interruptions or interference. Blessed by your presence and an outpouring of delectable retinal fluid."

    "The blood of the patriarch flows through my veins and into my dick, ballooning like an animal at a child’s birthday party."
    "But today is no birthday at all. It is a day of a reckoning and a day of rejoicing. "
    "We rejoice because we are able to support the weight of ourselves when the world will not, but are unable to support the weight of the world when our bodies grow too old."
    "I am in the prime of my life."
    "A young, sexually active man with abs of steel and an impressive cock- presented before a longer version of a girl I {b}LOATHE{/b} and her mutilated counterpart."
    "They are like superheroes, the two of them. Just instead of rescuing passersby, they are here to rescue me. "

    sev "Or is it more that they do?"
    sev "But that someone with scissors is sneaking into your room at night and cutting them up without asking for your permission."
    sev "I pose a simple question of philosophy- one that an intellectual like you should be able to answer even if your wires are currently tangled."
    sev "The question is this."

    sev "You did it together."
    sev "But it is not your headboard that clack-clacks today. It is the headboard of someone else. "
    sev "Someone else taking the one thing you love as you are forced to sit there and pretend you don’t know it."
    sev "Is it easy playing tricks on yourself?"

    "I’m able to make a ring out of my fingers and move up and and and and and and and down against the leg. "
    "I feel young again."
    "It is so very small. So small that I could fit at least half of it inside of my mouth if I removed it and diced it into tiny cubes."
    "The body the leg is attached to smiles at me, happy to feel the fingers of the chosen one as the rest look on in envy."
    "Onan did nothing wrong. "
    "And if anyone slipped on the semen in the hut, it was not Onan’s fault."
    "Sometimes, we just want to forget."

    "She doesn’t make much noise so she probably doesn’t feel that good but I do so it’s okay."

    "This will be my first time cumming in a bucket, but probably not my last since I know many girls who would like to collect my juices in a container like that."

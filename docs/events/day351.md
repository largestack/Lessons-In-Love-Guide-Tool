    "It appears that, thankfully, the last reset did not bring with it the reckoning of all of my new students."
    "In fact, we were able to make it through the day with almost near perfect attendance."
    "The only exceptions to that being the usual Yumi and Ayane who, after talking to Ami about it, wanted to take the day off for...mental health reasons or something like that."
    "I don’t know. The type of excuse or reason or whatever you want to call it doesn’t really matter to me because, as I’m sure you know-"

    a "Bananas are a good source of potassium."
    s "Very good, Ami. Thank you for paying attention to Makoto’s lecture on nutrients earlier today."
    a "Does potassium make girls feel better when they’re sad?"
    ki "Not really. But it does help take some of the pain away."
    n "Uhh...Anyway, I guess the three of us will just start heading over to the dorms."
    n "What are you going to do in the meantime?"
    s "Probably try to go home and then get stopped by another one of you girls on the way."
    a "Well, whoever it is, make sure that you tell them you’re off limits and that you’ll be too busy thinking of me to pay any attention to them today."
    a "Or any day."

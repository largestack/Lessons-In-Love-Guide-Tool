    scene chikayakuza11
    with dissolve

    y "I didn’t {i}want{/i} to come back here. Made me feel like a fuckin’ failure."

    c "All you had to do was talk to me."
    y "Yeah, well...you know I ain’t that good at that either."

    scene chikayakuza12
    with dissolve

    y "It ain’t like that."
    c "Then tell me what it’s like, Yumi. Because I’ve seen you do a ton of crazy shit before, but never anything like that. That was a new level of anger that I...I wasn’t ready for yet."

    scene chikayakuza16
    with dissolve

    y "I don’t fuckin’ know, Chika. But can we at least sit down if we’re gonna talk about this shit? Barely slept at all last night and my legs are fuckin’ killing me from doin’ so many laps around this place."
    c "Depends on if your goons are going to assault me again for setting foot on their beloved walkway."
    y "They’ll do whatever the fuck I tell ‘em to. I’m still the boss’s daughter even if I ain’t been here in a hot minute."

    "Through openings in the wood, the sun beats down on the backs of two girls who may {i}appear{/i} to be close at the moment, but could not be any further away when you really start to think about it."
    "This is speaking figuratively, of course. But given the amount of exposure you’ve had to these long-winded ramblings of mine, I’m sure I don’t have to tell you that."
    "The one on the right wants to know everything."
    "She wants to know why a girl she believed was getting better relapsed."
    "She can’t help but draw parallels to her best friend’s mother and how things like that might just run in the family."
    "But those are thoughts she hates herself for having."
    "The one on the left just wants it all to stop."
    "She doesn’t want to talk about this. But, at the same time, she doesn’t regret anything at all."
    "She, too, draws parallels to her mother. It’s all too easy when the lines outstretch toward her and her alone."
    "She thinks that maybe this is all she’s good for...and that the idea of ever trying to fit in or survive outside of these walls in the first place was nothing short of a pipe dream."

    if yumiknows == False:
        "But more than that, she’s worried the truth will get out."
        "She’s worried that it won’t just stop at what happened in the locker room-"
        "But that revealing the true nature of that unfortunate night will open the flood gates and she won’t be able to hold back everything {i}else{/i} that’s happened."
        "She won’t be able to hold back how unclean it all feels."
        "Or how she’s still too curious to just rinse it all off."
    else:
        "But more than that...she’s worried about hurting her one and only friend-"
        "And that confessing to what happened in the locker room on that unfortunate night will snowball into something that could result in more than just the shattering of herself."
        "The girl on the left knows for certain of the futility of the love her best friend pursues."
        "But her desire to see an honest smile on a bronze tinted face outweighs her desire to rid herself of the scattered impurities brought to light by someone who had it out for her."
        "And deep down, she can’t help but feel as if she deserved it."

    c "Have you talked to your dad at all?"
    y "For a minute or two. But it was the same old shit it’s always been. Dude’s still an asshole. But he’s an asshole with a house and I kinda figured I didn’t have a place to go anymore."
    y "Ain’t even allowed to come get my shit at the dorms since it’s technically school property. But I guess it ain’t like I’ve got much there to begin with."
    c "Anybody else here able to...you know...help get your mind off of stuff? Any of those guys you used to hang around with?"
    y "Nah. Heard a few of ‘em died from some of the older guys who are still here, though. Sucks."
    c "So you’ve just been...wandering around all sad and lonely this whole time?"

    y "It ain’t been that bad. At the very least, I can be alone here. And nobody’s ever gonna start shit with me."

    scene chikayakuza19

    c "Okay, now you’re straight up lying because I know for a fact that I piss you off every single morning."
    y "Yeah, but there’s a big difference between pissing me off because you take six hours to get ready and, like...{i}actually{/i} pissing me off."
    c "Beauty doesn’t come without its setbacks, Yumi. Just because it takes you five minutes to get ready doesn’t mean we can all be that lucky."
    y "Heh...me...lucky. That’s rich."

    y "You saw what happened."
    c "Ooookay. Then, are you going to tell me {i}why{/i} it happened?"
    y "..."
    c "Yumi, do you really think I would have trespassed on Yakuza turf and fought off two thugs if I didn’t want to be on your side? Fuck no."
    c "I’m basically dying for a reason to go to bat for you right now. But shit like “Oh, you guys just don’t understand her!” isn’t going to work this time."
    c "Nodoka was {i}fucked up{/i} for like a whole week. I’m surprised she came out of that without a concussion."
    y "How about everybody else?"
    c "What do you mean?"
    y "What are {i}they{/i} sayin’ about me?"

    c "No way. That wouldn’t make any sense."
    y "Why not? Bullied Futaba from the moment I met her. Tons of other people too."
    y "Still talk mad shit on Sensei and you guys are basically attached at the hip now."
    y "Maybe I just ain’t a good person?"
    c "Yeah...maybe you’re not. But you’re also not the type of person to just do shit like that without a reason."
    y "You also thought I wasn’t the type of person to come back {i}here{/i} of all places and I didn’t even last one day out on the streets."
    c "Yumi-"
    y "People change, Chika. You gotta remember where I come from."
    y "I’m the daughter of a Yakuza boss and a junkie. Ain’t exactly the model family a lot of other people grow up with."

    c "Did I fuck up guessing where you went? Yeah. Yeah, I did. But I was also holding out hope that you were going to come back to {i}my{/i} family before the one you left to try and become a better {i}you.{/i}"
    c "Chinami is worried sick. We want you back."
    c "But right now, what I want more than anything is to understand what happened to you so you don’t just...lose all of the progress you’ve made."

    with dissolve

    y "Honestly, Chika...{i}fuck{/i} progress. The hell was I going to get out of that anyway?"
    y "Ain’t like I was tryin’ to make friends or something. If anything, I don’t even know if I’d call any of that “progress” since I was just...backtracking on all of the bad shit I’ve done."
    y "No reason to clap and cheer for me for finally turning around when I’ve been runnin’ the race in the wrong direction my whole life. Might as well just...quit and save myself the embarrassment, you know?"
    c "I don’t...but I’m going to clap and cheer for you any chance I get since you’re my best friend. I just wish you’d trust me enough to confide in me."

    y "Doesn’t matter. It’s in the past now."
    y "So my reputation is dead in the water. Big deal. Ain’t like I’m ever comin’ back to school in the first place."

    y "Let’s be real. I never fit in there anyway. And if we had any other teacher, I probably would’ve been kicked out already."
    c "But...no. No, I can’t let you do that. You always talk about how you want to make something of yourself and...and if you’re dropping out...what are you going to do instead? What does that mean for us?"
    y "For us? Not much. If you ain’t scared of me after almost killin’ Nodoka and shit, I’m happy to keep bein’ friends with you."
    y "But for {i}me?{/i}"
    y "I don’t know."
    y "Maybe I’ll hang out here for a while? Give the whole Yakuza princess shit a spin and see how that goes."
    c "That’s..."
    c "But that’s...the exact opposite of what you’ve been trying to do this whole time."
    y "It is, ain’t it?"
    y "Means it might actually work."

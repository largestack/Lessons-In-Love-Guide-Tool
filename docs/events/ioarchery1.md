    "The desire to see small girls wielding dangerous weapons beckons me toward the archery club’s morning meeting. "
    "But it is upon the realization of this desire that I transition into wanting to see small girls who are {i}not{/i} wielding dangerous weapons, as doing so detracts from the attention I should be receiving."
    "At least {i}one{/i} teacher is the recipient of such attention, though. But what I don’t like about that is that she probably has just as much of a chance at sleeping with Uta as I do."
    "If only I knew how to use a bow. Maybe then I could launch Cupid’s arrow straight through the heart of everyone here and take them all back to my house for one giant, ponytail-filled orgy."

    w "Your grip on the arrow is too loose. And if you don’t start straightening out your wrist, you’re going to cause serious damage to it."
    u "But I’ve hit the target every single time."
    w "That doesn’t mean you’re not making any mistakes. What good is hitting the target at all if your method in doing so could lead to injury?"
    w "Try it again but focus on your wrist instead of hitting the target. Missing right now is fine so long as you develop proper form."
    u "Are your hands always this cold, Miss Watabe?"
    w "Everything is cold when you’re dead inside. Now, do what I tell you as you’re the one girl here who’s shown any amount of promise so far."

    i "Sensei! Good morning. I didn’t realize you were going to be here today."
    s "I didn’t realize {i}you{/i} were going to be here today either. Since when do you participate in literally anything?"
    i "Oh, I’m not participating. I’ve been sitting under a tree and waiting for Uta to finish since we got here."
    i "She’s weirdly adamant about this archery stuff and her desire to drag me down with her has become very annoying."
    i "I did find a really cool caterpillar, though. Hanging out with him was a good use of like, twenty minutes. But I just put him back on the tree since I like you a little more than bugs."
    s "Just a little?"
    i "Or a lot if saying “a lot” gets you to like me more. I also spent twenty minutes figuring out things to say that would make me sound less clingy, but in true Io fashion, I have already given up."
    s "I’m fine with your...adhesiveness. It would just probably be a little smarter to not say things like that in a place where Kirin could easily gain access to a weapon."
    i "Don’t worry, Sensei. I would take the arrow for you."
    s "I was more suggesting that you’d be the one she shoots."

    scene ioarchery3
    with dissolve

    i "Oh, well that’s no big deal. Uta’s a better shot than her and she’d protect me."
    s "Would Uta...not protect me? "
    i "Idunno. Maybe? She does like you. I just don’t know if she likes you enough to murder someone."
    s "Are you saying you {i}do{/i} like me enough to murder someone?"
    i "Sometimes, I think about murdering people for reasons that don’t even pertain to you. So probably."
    s "You’re just a walking red flag, aren’t you?"
    i "Kind of, yeah. I’m surprised you don’t just walk past me at this point."
    s "If you weren’t so cute, I probably would."
    i "My mind tells me that I should be saddened by that response, but my mind sucks so I am going to ignore that and just revel in the fact that I’m cute enough to stop you in your tracks."
    s "..."
    i "..."
    i "Uta’s so cool, isn’t she? I wonder if I’ll ever be able to draw a bow like that."
    s "If only there was some sort of place you could practice."
    i "Yeah...if only."

    scene ioarchery2
    with dissolve

    i "Oh well. Since there’s not, wanna go hang out in the shade where I can say more clingy things without either of us having to worry about some bitch with a side ponytail going rogue and killing us?"
    s "As long as you don’t try introducing me to your caterpillar friend. I’m not very fond of insects."
    i "Cody the Caterpillar would be very upset to hear that, but sure. I can probably keep our little retreat bug-free if that’s what you want."

    "Io and I sneak away from Uta and Wakana, walking behind the rest of the girls as well in hopes of them not seeing where we’re about to run off to."
    "She takes me behind a small building where I’m assuming they store all of their equipment and slaps the wall of it as if to tell me this is where we’ll be hiding for now."

    scene ioarchery4
    with dissolve2

    "Given the type of person she is, I’m not surprised to find that she’s already uncovered a location concealed from the prying eyes of girls she tells herself she despises."
    "I think whether or not she actually {i}does{/i} is another story entirely."
    "It’s easier to block people out than to let them in, and if you convince yourself that everyone is someone to be hated before even meeting them, you can shield yourself from being let down."
    "But what you shouldn’t be doing along with that is constantly drawing attention to it, for when you doubt yourself to begin with, the last thing you’ll benefit from is the sound of your own voice."
    "Unfortunately, I think Io has gotten so used to the act of blocking things out that, more often than not, the sound of her own voice is the only thing she hears."
    "And if I were her, I’d be annoyed by that too."

    i "So...what do you want to talk about? The weather? The news? What our plans are for this weekend and how we don’t actually have any, so we’re going to spend the entire time with each other?"
    s "Smooth."

    scene ioarchery5
    with dissolve

    i "I can be good at stuff when I want to be. I just don’t normally want to be."
    s "I guess I might be able to free up some time this weekend. Or next weekend. Or some weekend. "
    s "Or whenever I really think about it, I guess."
    i "The fact that I cross your mind at all is already more than I deserve, so whenever works for you is what is best for me."
    s "Other than mornings, apparently. Since you are now defying all expectations and actually coming to club meetings."

    scene ioarchery6
    with dissolve

    i "That’s not something I {i}have{/i} to do, though. I’m just trying to make Uta happy since she’s always going above and beyond for me."
    i "The truth is that I kind of hate archery. I think it’s annoying and stupidly traditional and that the outfits are too hot."
    i "I guess the woodworking on some of the bows is really neat, though. I wonder if I’d be able to make one with a little practice?"
    s "You picked a weird club to join for someone who apparently hates archery."
    i "True. But I hate most things, so I was kind of screwed the moment they announced we {i}had{/i} to join a club."
    i "I tried to get out of it the best I could by just not submitting the paper, but then I realized that being disciplined might mean I wouldn’t get to see you anymore, so I backtracked and just did what Uta was doing."
    i "Seems to be a recurring thing for me, really. Just following her lead since she’s able to actually walk without her feet being chained to giant cinderblocks."
    s "You’re not always following her lead, though. If you were, you’d have more than one friend."

    scene ioarchery7
    with dissolve

    i "Excuse me, good sir. I have {i}two{/i} friends. I just have an unquenchable desire to cuddle and watch movies with one of them."
    s "Does Uta know you feel that way about her?"
    i "Hmm...she does seem like she’d be a good cuddler. I think I’d rather be with someone a little taller, though. Someone with a penis."

    scene ioarchery8
    with dissolve

    s "Well, I sure hope Uta doesn’t have one of those."
    i "It’s funny because I was sure she {i}did{/i} have one of those back in the day. Boy, was that a surprise."
    s "Weird friendship backstory aside, I think it might be good for you if you actually...you know...{i}did{/i} make another female friend."
    i "Pass. I’m content with the one that I have now. Any more would be a fucking nightmare."
    s "What if it was someone like Kirin?"

    scene ioarchery9
    with dissolve

    i "That would be even worse! You suggested literally the last person in class I would even {i}consider{/i} being friends with!"
    s "And why is that?"
    i "Have you {i}seen{/i} how toxic that girl is? There’s so much poison pouring out of everything she says that the whole room starts dying the moment she speaks."
    s "You’re pretty toxic yourself, though."
    i "Do you think I’d seize the opportunity to be friends with {i}myself?{/i} Because that’s the only thing I can think of that would be even worse than Kirin."
    i "One of the key reasons I like Uta so much is that she’s the complete opposite of that. She like, kills toxicity. It’s good for counteracting the things I do."

    scene ioarchery10
    with dissolve

    s "I’m just saying I think you two have a lot in common and that you’d be able to talk without inherently hating one another."
    s "At the very least, it seems like she wants to be friends with {i}you.{/i}"
    i "I don’t really care about what Kirin wants. "
    s "Do you care about what I want?"
    i "Of course."
    s "Just not when it’s something that conflicts with your own personal interests?"

    scene ioarchery11
    with dissolve

    i "Where’s this coming from? I just wanted to hang out with you and have fun. If I wanted to confront my demons first thing in the morning, I would have medicated before leaving the house."
    s "Just a thought. I could have kept it inside but I figured that was pointless since you don’t keep {i}anything{/i} inside ever."

    scene ioarchery12
    with dissolve

    i "I keep plenty inside."
    s "Like what?"
    i "Like how I hate that {i}you{/i} like Kirin when she’s just one out of millions of other fakes wandering around Japan, hoping to find something to make her feel whole."
    i "I also hate her lack of understanding when it comes to people’s boundaries as she would literally {i}not{/i} stop questioning me about you on the way back home from the Christmas party."
    i "But I realize that’s less of a thing I was keeping inside and more of a thing I just didn’t share with you due to lack of timely relevancy. "
    s "She questioned you on the way back home from the Christmas thing?"
    i "Relentlessly. And the vast majority of it was extremely personal. Things no one should just blatantly and unabashedly discuss despite barely knowing one another."

    scene ioarchery13
    with dissolve

    s "Yeah...that sounds like her."
    i "I’ve got...limits, you know? Like, not everything is easy for me to just talk about."
    i "And if I had somebody in my life who was always trying to force that out of me...well, things would suck even more than they do right now."
    s "I get that. But I also think you also have to understand that if things suck right now, they’re going to keep sucking for the rest of forever unless you actually do something about it."
    s "Would you rather get to know someone who’s interested in getting to know {i}you,{/i} despite all of the obstacles you throw their way...or someone who’s shown no interest in you whatsoever?"
    i "The latter. Anyone who shows any interest in me has extraordinarily bad taste."
    s "Try it again but with less self-loathing."

    scene ioarchery14
    with dissolve

    i "But that’s so hard! You’re taking away my most defining trait!"
    s "Yeah, well when your most defining trait is also your biggest weakness as a person, it’s good to peel it back every once in a while."
    s "Being depended on is cool and all and I’m glad that you...think you’re whatever that weird burrowing sperm fish is-"
    i "Anglerfish. "
    s "Yeah, that. I’m glad you’re able to think up weird metaphors about our relationship because it solidifies my sense of importance when it comes to your life and...that’s a thing I think I need."
    s "But I also want you to be able to exist on your own because you remind me of myself and I still don’t really know how to do that."

    scene ioarchery15
    with dissolve

    i "Did you just..."
    i "Did you just open up to me?"
    s "I guess. But I did it more for myself than I did for you."
    s "Watching you “succeed” would be for my own personal benefit at the end of the day. And if getting you to feel uncomfortable in pursuit of that is what it winds up taking, I {i}want{/i} you to be uncomfortable."
    i "Me...making more friends...will somehow make {i}you{/i} feel better about {i}yourself?{/i}"
    s "It’s weird how our minds work sometimes, isn’t it?"

    scene ioarchery16
    with dissolve

    i "That’s so strange. Because any time I think of you forming more relationships, I just get pissed off and jealous."
    s "Not all of my relationships are sexual, you know."
    i "I guess not. But according to Kirin, the ones you care most about are. "
    i "Why she’d somehow spin that into pressuring {i}me{/i} to crumble when she very obviously likes you as well, I don’t get. "
    i "But I guess that all of our minds are little messed up when you start applying actual logic to them."
    s "..."
    i "..."
    i "Is it too much to ask for a brain that doesn’t break down every time you try to use it?"
    s "It’s too much to ask for anything. Life is going to give us what it gives us and all we can do is scarf it down or starve ourselves. There’s no third option."
    i "Life kind of sucks, doesn’t it?"
    s "Why else would we constantly try to distract ourselves from it?"
    i "..."
    s "..."
    i "This was a good talk. I enjoyed this."
    i "I figured I was still like, a year away from learning anything about you. So the fact that I now think I understand something is..."
    i "I guess for lack of a better term-"
    i "A good distraction."

    "Io and I leave our spot behind the storage building and wander back into the lives of everyone else, knowing full well that our prior distraction had overstayed its welcome. "
    "I’m glad she has another one now, though."
    "What I’m not glad about is that it now feels like a small piece of me is missing."
    "But when I’m the one who ripped it off and so carefully placed it into her hands, I don’t really have any right to complain."
    "When we round the corner, I step on something soft. "
    "It sticks to my shoe and I have to kick the dirt in order to get it off."
    "I won’t tell you what it was."

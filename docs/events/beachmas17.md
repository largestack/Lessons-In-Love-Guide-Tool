    ima "Okay! Nevermind! Guess we can all sit here and fuck ourselves while we wait! In a nonliteral way, of course, so Kirin and Nodoka don’t combine brains and have a collective aneurysm!"
    ki "Just implanting the thought in my head is enough to get me through the night."
    n "Sure, Kirin. As if it wasn’t already there. "
    ima "Hey! Here’s a fun idea! How about, instead of oversharing the things that turn us on, we share our favorite Christmas memories! Starting with Ami!"

    mo "The quality isn’t as good as mine, but I still managed to channel enough of my energy into it to allow the orb to float. Just don’t poke it or it may explode and kill you."
    ya "Am I really allowed to have this?"
    mo "Of course! Tis’ the season, after all."
    ya "I mean religiously. Magic goes against the tenets of my beliefs and even holding such an object puts me at risk of disintegration. "

    mo "Tsk tsk tsk. There is no {i}real{/i} magic imbued in this staff, Yasu. The {i}real{/i} magic is the friends we made along the way."

    to "No thank you. I have trouble eating when I’m nervous and I worry that I’m about to once again ruin Christmas."
    t "If you are going to murder someone, I believe Io would be the best choice. She contributes nothing to the class and would only be missed by one person. "

    to "And yes, that record may be comprised of just one thing, but that does nothing to dispel my worries and Sensei is {i}already{/i} difficult to shop for when his interests are limited to just...women."
    mo "Sir appears to like the shirt I made for him. He’s been regularly wearing it for a whole year now. "
    ya "I’m sure that whatever you got for our teacher will be great, Touka. You’re so kind and smart and good and have so much money to spend on material goods."
    mo "What’d you get him anyway? I don’t remember you bringing anything with you on the bus ride over. Well, apart from your seemingly infinite inventory of cosmetic equipment."
    t "You can never have too many breast-accentuating tops. Isn’t that right, noodle-refuser?"
    mo "You could always give the Herald a wardrobe malfunction for Christmas. I’m sure that would go over well."

    m "Unless I was assigned someone I’m not friends with. In that case, I’d just be a bad person. "
    a "How do you not even remember who you got? You had two whole months to plan this."
    m "I’ll find out sooner or later. Just keep an eye out for anyone else walking around empty handed. "

    scene beachmassanta21

    c "No. This is just a thing I’m getting you involved with because of how much I love you. Which is a lot. And it’s okay if I say that since nobody else can hear us right now."
    s "Correct. But this also means that there is another present waiting for me back in that room and you are keeping me from it."

    "In fact, it’s hard to recall {i}anything{/i} that’s happened at this point when my relationship with Yumi is arguably one of the most convoluted ones I have...and it’s all for reasons I don’t understand."
    "She’s never made it to the rooftop. She’s never even entered my house. "
    "And her feelings, though blurred by my serpent tongue and its tendency to graze the skin of my unsuspecting prey, are all skin deep."

    "If I coiled around her body...waited patiently for her to stop moving..."
    "{b}DEVOURED HER WHOLE{/b}"

    y "I did a lot of thinking in my time away from school...mostly about how I wished I would’ve fucked Nodoka up even harder, but I thought a lot about {i}you{/i} too."
    y "But before you go freakin’ out again about how horrible of a douche we all know you are, there were some actual, like...{i}good{/i} thoughts in there."
    y "Maybe it’s just cause I’m so used to all of the adults in my life being fuckin’ worthless criminals...but you ain’t been all that bad by comparison."

    s "I do...but I don’t think you would have had Chika bring me here if that’s all you wanted to say."
    s "So what else is there? Do you want to make up? Or is this your way of telling me to leave you alone for the rest of forever- a thing we both know I wouldn’t be able to do?"

    scene beachmassanta28
    with dissolve

    y "I don’t fuckin’ know, man. I’ve been thinkin’ nonstop about all of the shit I was gonna say over the last 24 hours, and now that you’re here, all I wanna do is call you a jack-off and tell you to eat shit."
    y "Why’d you have to go and say all that stuff about yourself, man? Are you {i}trying{/i} to confuse me? Because it fuckin’ worked if that’s what you were going for."
    s "I just want to be honest with you. And that’s a pretty big deal since I can’t even be honest with myself most of the time."
    y "Honesty fucking hurts. Why couldn’t you just keep lyin’ to me and save me from actually havin’ to use my shitty ass brain? None of this makes sense."

    i "In a perfect world, which obviously doesn’t exist, the ideal scenario would just be him and a trauma-less Io together. But there are loads of problems with that and it would never work."
    i "I can’t provide what Sensei needs in a relationship and, frankly, if he was with me every single day, he’d get tired and fed up after like, a week."
    i "By that logic, having someone else come in to provide what I can’t, namely someone I also love, IE: you...is not just the quickest path to a future where I can be happy with him, but the {i}only{/i} path."
    i "The only issue is that that wouldn’t make {i}you{/i} happy. And I could never ask you to be my sex proxy if you’re not into the same guy as me."
    i "Does that make more sense?"
    u "Uhh........{i}no?{/i}"

    u "So...what? My job would be to lay there and have sex with him while you two do all of the fun, cute, couple stuff together?"
    i "Of course not. All three of us could do fun couple stuff together. But we could also get private time whenever we want it. The big thing is that you’d be the only one he actually has sex with. And I’d just be Io."

    i "Oh, is there a name for it? Cool. "
    i "It would really only work with you, though. The idea of Sensei with anyone else makes me want to puke. "
    i "But I don’t put you in the same bracket as everyone else. You’re an essential part of my life and, in many ways, the glue that holds me together. The hinges to my door. "
    i "Plus, the two of us falling for the same guy would eliminate the risk of you ever dating someone I {i}don’t{/i} like and trying to drag them into the group. I really don’t see any downsides."
    i "Well, other than the fact that you don’t like him and I would never force you to do something like that for my sake alone."

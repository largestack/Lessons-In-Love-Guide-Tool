    no "Guess who~"
    mak "Hah..."
    mak "The same person who does this to every single one of us after every single practice?"
    no "Aww, don’t say it like that, Makoto. You know you’re my favorite out of everyone here."
    no "Besides, if you {i}didn’t{/i} want me to latch onto you like this, you’d stop using shampoo with such an enticing scent."

    scene nodokashower3
    with dissolve

    mak "So it’s not even safe for me to use my regular shampoo anymore? I must adapt to a completely new lifestyle just to prevent you from groping me?"
    no "You could always just reciprocate my one-sided lust for you instead. I promise I’ll be both gentle {i}and{/i} discreet. No one here would even know."
    mak "Uhh...{i}I{/i} would know. That’s exactly the problem."
    no "That doesn’t sound like much of a problem to me."

    scene nodokashower4
    with dissolve

    mak "That’s probably because you’re an insatiable lust demon who has seemingly devoted her entire purpose of living to making me feel uncomfortable."
    no "You say that, but we both know how wet you are right now."
    mak "I am literally in the shower."
    no "And I am very glad that you are. "
    no "What better place for the two smartest girls in school to bond than under a steady stream of hot water that we can use as an excuse to explain how flustered we are?"

    scene nodokashower5
    with dissolve

    mak "I was flustered the first three times you did this. By now, I have accepted it as just one more bump in the rocky road that is my life."
    no "Then why not accept what comes next as well? If history repeats itself, you should only be flustered the first three times. After that, I’m sure you’ll look forward to these special meetings just as much as I do."
    mak "Nodoka, you do realize that {i}every{/i} girl isn’t bisexual, correct?"
    no "I do not. "
    no "Girls know better than anyone just how attractive girls are. And the idea of there being some who intentionally deny that to maintain the guise of complete heterosexuality perplexes me."
    no "Why not indulge in these forbidden desires? You surely wouldn’t be the first female to have an orgasm in the shower room, you know. "
    no "Did you know the shower heads are detachable? You just need to move one of the benches over since they’re quite hard to reach with how high up they are."
    mak "I will keep that in mind if I ever feel compelled to pleasure myself in a room full of my friends."
    no "What better time to pleasure one’s self than in that exact scenario?"
    mak "Every time, Nodoka. Every time is better than that."

    scene nodokashower6
    with dissolve

    no "Fair enough. I suppose the urge to pleasure yourself isn’t as strong as it is for the rest of us."
    no "What, with you already having an outlet for those desires of yours in our teacher and whatnot."

    scene nodokashower7
    with dissolve

    mak "I-"
    mak "I have no such thing! Where would you even-"
    no "Oh, come on. You think I don’t know?"
    no "I’ve read enough erotica to understand that there are no “pure” relationships between a perverted man in power and his loyal assistant."
    no "So, how long has it been now? How many times has he let it out inside?"

    scene nodokashower8
    with dissolve

    mak "Z...Zero! Even if we {i}did{/i} have that sort of relationship, which we don’t, I’m smart enough to not allow something like that."
    mak "Having a child at this point in life would derail all that I’ve worked for."
    no "Yes...perhaps it would. "

    scene nodokashower9
    with dissolve

    no "{i}But think about how good it would feel...{/i}"
    mak "Nodoka..."
    no "{i}His thick cock, pulsing inside of you...causing your tiny, precious body to overflow with his sweet, hot honey...{/i}"
    mak "This..."
    mak "This is starting to get out of hand, Nodoka. I’d really prefer it if you-"
    no "Oh, my sweet Makoto. Your secret is safe with me. I’d just like to...capitalize on it while I have the chance."
    mak "C...Capitalize...how?"

    scene nodokashower10
    with dissolve

    no "You know, I always thought it a tad unfair how your breasts are bigger than mine despite me being a little taller. Shouldn’t they grow {i}with{/i} our bodies rather than having minds of their own?"
    mak "They...don’t have minds. And it’s not like mine are that big to begin with. But, getting back to the thing about capitalization-"
    no "Those were just {i}words,{/i} Makoto. Words exchanged between two girls several pedestals higher than the rest. No one can hear us from so far below."
    no "But I suppose that has its cons as well for someone as nervous and worried as you."
    mak "This..."
    mak "You’re not intending to...{i}blackmail{/i} me...are you?"

    scene nodokashower11
    with dissolve

    no "Blackmail? {i}You?{/i} What reason would I have to do that?"
    no "I’m actually quite fond of you, you know."
    mak "Yes...you are making that very apparent with the way you’re fondling my breasts right now."
    no "Isn’t that just something girls do in school showers?"
    mak "Umm...n...not usually?"

    scene nodokashower12
    with fade

    no "Really? I thought it was okay for us to explore each others bodies? For educational purposes, of course."
    mak "Um-"
    no "Otherwise, how would we come to understand the ins and outs of sex? Pun not intended."
    no "It’s not like {i}all of us{/i} can have a big...strong...older man teach us... "
    mak "Nodoka, please watch where-"
    no "Say, do you keep this area trimmed? Or have you just not grown much hair yet?"
    mak "Wha-"
    no "Is he the one who asks you to keep it this way? Or is this a conscious decision on your part? "
    no "Again, if you’re still in the early stages of puberty, feel free to disregard that. It’s just-"

    scene nodokashower13
    with dissolve

    mak "Okay. You’re done. "

    scene nodokashower14
    with fade

    no "What’s wrong? Can’t a girl finger her friend in the privacy of the shower room without being stopped by the exact friend she’s trying to finger?"
    mak "Absolutely not! "
    mak "It’s one thing to consistently grope me in here every single day of the week- a thing that I should {i}not{/i} be so accustomed to, by the way."
    mak "But when..."

    scene nodokashower15
    with dissolve

    mak "When you start whispering about...sweet, hot honey and...commenting on my...you know..."
    mak "N-Not to mention the ridiculous accusations you’re throwing around about Sensei and me. "
    mak "You’re just...you’re just crossing way too many lines right now. "
    no "Apologies. I wasn’t trying to offend you. And if it seems that I was setting you up for blackmail, I can assure you that is not the case either."
    mak "It’s...fine. Just...stop groping me. I’m not interested in you that way."
    no "Is it because I don’t have a penis?"

    scene nodokashower16
    with dissolve

    mak "It’s obviously more than that!"
    no "Really?"
    no "Well it can’t be because of my hair. Or my intellect. Or the fact that I wear glasses. Or the fact that I am mildly manipulative and self serving. Or a bit of a narcissist. Or have an overactive imagination and sex drive."
    mak "It’s all of those things!"
    no "Our teacher has all of those things as well. All he has that I do not is a penis."

    scene nodokashower17
    with dissolve

    no "Oh! It’s an {i}age{/i} thing, isn’t it?"
    no "Have you always specifically been into older men? Or is this some sort of...newfound complex you’ve developed as the result of being constantly objectified and mentally abused by the man you like?"
    mak "Sensei doesn’t {i}abuse{/i} me. He just...he doesn’t understand what I need sometimes."
    no "Which is?"
    mak "I don’t know...someone who just...cares?"
    mak "Who will sit with me and...calm me down when my mind starts racing..."
    mak "Who will do little things for me, like...hold my hand or..."
    mak "Or..."
    mak "You know...stuff like that..."

    scene nodokashower18
    with dissolve

    no "I see, I see."
    no "I learned a lot about you today, Makoto."
    no "Right down to every last pubic hair."
    mak "And yet you are still treating my body as if it is some sort of toy."

    scene nodokashower19
    with dissolve

    no "Will you allow me to make it up to you?"
    mak "Are you just creating another opportunity to try and finger me right now?"
    no "Of course not. I, Nodoka Nagasawa, now understand that you, Makoto Miyamura, genuinely {i}do not{/i} want to be fingered by another girl."
    no "Up until a few moments ago, I was still on the fence about what to believe in regard to that. You have changed my life today."
    mak "You..."

    scene nodokashower20
    with dissolve

    mak "You make me really uncomfortable sometimes, you know..."
    no "Then allow me to do the opposite for a change in assisting you with the rest of your shower."
    mak "Showering is something I can do alone. It’s not a two person job."
    no "Can I help wash your hair at least?"
    mak "Nodoka-"
    no "Pleeeeeeease?"
    mak "..."
    no "..."

    scene nodokashower21
    with dissolve

    mak "The hair on my head?"
    no "Of course. Unless you’d rather-"
    mak "No. That much is fine."
    mak "But as soon as you’re done, you’re to leave this stall and never return. Do you understand?"
    no "Heh. Little do you know, I {i}like{/i} being disciplined. Put me in my place more often, Makoto."
    mak "Just...shut up and do your thing already, okay?"

    mak "..."
    no "..."
    mak "You’re actually pretty good at this."
    no "Yes, well..."
    no "I guess you could say I have a little experience."
    no "So, tell me more about the forbidden relationship you apparently do not have. When did you first realize that our teacher was the one for you?"
    mak "I didn’t. That never happened and the relationship we have is completely pure in nature."
    no "Okay. Then, {i}hypothetically speaking,{/i} if you {i}were{/i} to ever fall for him...what would be the cause? How would that story go?"
    mak "..."
    no "..."
    mak "Hypothetically speaking?"
    no "Mhm. And don’t worry about this hypothetical scenario extending to outside of this stall. I have no intention of revealing what you say to anyone at all."
    mak "..."
    no "..."
    mak "Well...hypothetically speaking..."
    mak "If I ever fell for Sensei...it would likely be for a number of reasons."
    mak "While he may seem mostly dismissive of me...and entirely unappreciative of all I do for him..."
    mak "I don’t think things are really as...one-sided as that."
    mak "Sure, it annoys me to no end...But when the school year began, I was trying way too hard to impress everyone. Granted, I’m still trying way too hard in a number of ways-"
    mak "But he was the first one to ever really notice that, I think."
    mak "He saw right through my disguise...all the way to the deeply flawed, stressed out, exhausting girl I am. And he treated me in accordance with that."
    mak "Combine that with how handsome and smart he is...and how I was kind of desperate for another male figure in my life after my dad was drafted to the space war...and..."
    mak "Well, it was only a matter of time until my curiosity turned into admiration. And then my admiration into...something else."
    mak "Is it wrong for me to expect more of him when he’s just as broken up on the inside as me? Maybe. "
    mak "But that’s why I’m able to put up with the constant unappreciation and dismissiveness. "
    mak "I like that he’s there for me. "
    mak "I just don’t like the form that takes sometimes."

    scene nodokashower23
    with dissolve

    mak "H-Hypothetically, of course!"
    mak "That’s just how things would be {i}if{/i} I ever started seeing him. Which I am not."
    no "Has anyone ever told you how cute you are, Makoto?"

    scene nodokashower24
    with dissolve

    mak "That’s...not really a word people use to describe me very often. So...thanks, I guess."
    no "No. Thank {i}you{/i} for taking the time out of your busy schedule to let me wash the chlorine out of your hair."
    no "I am truly unworthy."
    mak "Wh..."
    mak "What about you?..."
    no "What {i}about{/i} me?"
    mak "I mean...how do {i}you{/i} feel about Sensei?"
    no "Hypothetically?"
    mak "Yeah...hypothetically."
    no "Hm..."
    mak "..."
    no "He’s kind of like..."
    no "A dad."

    scene nodokashower25

    no "A dad that I want to watch fuck all of my friends."

    scene nodokashower26
    with dissolve

    mak "Heh?"
    no "You know. I’d take them home after school. Leave the room to go make tea or something."
    no "Then hear them crying out in pleasure from downstairs as he makes love to them on my bed."
    no "It’s less romantic than your story, but who says all stories need to be romantic?"
    no "Sometimes, a girl just wants her dad to fuck her friends, you know?"
    mak "..."

    no "I have other matters to tend to after this."
    mi "Suit yourself, but it’s half off mozzarella sticks today and I think you’re gonna regret it."
    mi "You hear that, Makoto? Half off mozzarella sticks. You love mozzarella sticks."

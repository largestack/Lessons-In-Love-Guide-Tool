    os "Mmphpphphphfff?!"
    ima "Big oof."
    ima "Sucks to be you, Senpai. Thought we had her for a second. Guess it’s good that no homes were wrecked during tonight’s festivities, though."
    s "Me too. I’m pretty sure Osako could kill me just by looking at me if she really wanted to."
    ri "Ahh..."
    ima "Shh, Rika. Don’t cry. It’s okay."
    ri "It’s coming again! I can’t hold back!"
    ima "And...probably don’t say anything that’ll get our male companion here excited either."
    s "I’ve seen two lesbian couples make out in less than five minutes. It’s a little too late for that."
    ima "{i}Technically,{/i} I’m bisexual. And Rika and I aren’t a couple. "
    s "Shut up, Imani. You’re ruining the moment."

    os "Mmf...mmnch...Wa...kana?..."
    os "Everyone is...mnch...watching..."

    scene yuritime3
    with dissolve

    w "Apologies, my sweet. I just couldn’t help myself anymore."
    os "You don’t...have to apologize...I just...you know...it’s a little...embarrassing? And...sudden?"
    w "Can it really be called sudden if you’ve kept me waiting all night?"
    os "Uhh...umm..."

    scene yuritime4
    with fade

    ima "Okay, so...either those “adverse effects” that Wakana was talking about {i}really{/i} get to her...or she’s just mad turned on from the two of us fulfilling her dare."
    ri "I need another drink."

    scene yuritime5

    s "Yes. But the night isn’t over yet."
    ima "Holdin’ out hope that those two might let you join in on the action?"
    s "Right now, I’m just trying to enjoy the show. And your commentary isn’t helping."

    scene yuritime6
    with fade

    os "Mmf........mlm.......mm~"
    ri "You know, the fact that they’re doing this without even being dared is very offensive and not how this game is supposed to work. I would like a refund, please."
    ima "I think Wakana just needs to get the horny out of her system. Better to do that with her girlfriend than some random guy off the street."
    ri "Woah, you found him on the street? What a crazy coincidence that he wound up being a teacher too."
    ima "That aside, can we talk about how Osako just radiates bottom energy for a second?"
    ima "You’d think that being a fucking martial arts god or whatever that she might feel a little more...I don’t know, powerful when it comes to this stuff?"
    s "I think things work well this way and I wouldn’t change their dynamic at all."
    ima "Yeah, but you’re pitching a tent the size of Fujisan right now. You’d be happy with anything."
    os "Wakana...mmf...Wakana~"

    scene yuritime7

    w "And I you. "

    w "It’s hard to say, my kitten."
    w "But perhaps I could show you?"
    os "Show...me?..."
    os "But...we’re-"

    scene yuritime8
    with dissolve

    w "I know you’ve all been anxiously awaiting her arrival, but I’m afraid that I will be whisking this one away for a short while. "
    w "Please continue on with your game without paying much mind to what the two of us are doing."
    w "Oh...and best of luck, Arakawa. "
    w "I can only imagine how hard it must be for you right now."

    scene yuritime9
    with dissolve

    scene yuritime10

    ri "Why can’t it be me having hot, kinky bathroom sex with my partner?! I like hot, kinky bathroom sex too!"
    ima "You doing okay, Senpai? Looks like the cable went out without you ever getting to see the ending of your show. "
    ima "Well, assuming you don’t follow the two of them into the bathroom. Which I wouldn’t really blame you for at this point."
    s "I think I’m {i}slightly{/i} above doing something like that, Imani. Just slightly, though."

    scene yuritime11
    with dissolve

    ima "Really? Cause I’ve been wrong before, but I'm gonna agree with Rika. I felt some mad tension right there. "
    s "Between those two? Yes. Between anyone else, I don’t think so."
    ima "Dude, did you see the way she smirked at you? Because I’ll be damned if that wasn’t a “Hahah, look what you can’t have” smirk."
    ima "And if there's anything I know about “Hahah, look what you can’t have” smirks, it's that you can {i}totally{/i} have whatever it is you want."
    s "She’s just fucking with me like she always does. There’s no way she’d actually go through with something like that."
    ima "Listen, man. I like Osako, so I’m not going to say something like “You should have sex with her girlfriend and ruin her life.”"
    ima "But straight up, I’m pretty sure you could have sex with her girlfriend and ruin her life."
    ri "Sex ruins everyone’s lives and no one should ever have it because it only ends in pain and misery and trips to a bar with a bunch of people you’ve never seen before and don’t fit in with."

    scene yuritime12
    with dissolve

    ima "Hey, don’t say that! I think you fit in just fine! Even with the whole “ruining my self-esteem” part since Senpai does that to me every day."
    ri "I don’t. I never fit in with young people anymore."
    ri "This is exactly why my daughter says I embarrass her. Because I’m stupid and dumb and embarrassing and stupid."
    ima "Young people?..."
    ima "Daughter?..."
    ima "How..."
    ima "How old are you, Rika?..."
    ri "I’m 42."

    scene yuritime13

    ima "You’re {i}what?!{/i}"
    s "Honestly, you look younger than 30. Good for you."
    ima "I made out with a 42 year old?!"
    ima "You could be my mom!"
    ri "Yeah, but then I’d just embarrass {i}you{/i} too."
    s "I think you’re officially the oldest person I know."
    ri "Yeah. Rub it in, why don’t you?"
    ima "No wonder you gave me a 6/10! You’ve got decades worth of experience under your belt and I’m just a mere caterpillar in the world of girl on girl contact!"
    ri "I wish I was with the other two in the bathroom right now. I bet no one is making {i}them{/i} feel like a fucking loser."

    w "I’m a wonderful owner, aren’t I? There aren’t many of us who’d help alleviate some of the tension when our pets go into heat."
    os "Oh God.......it’s so good.......It’s.......so good!"
    w "Oh...What’s this?..."
    w "I think I may be beginning to tear a hole in your precious underwear, my kitten. "
    w "That would be the third pair just this month."
    w "At this rate, we may even wear down everything you own. "
    w "Should we maybe stop putting ourselves in situations like this? Or will you continue to be disobedient and needy instead?"
    os "I’ll do...anything you want...just...please don’t stop...please don’t stop..."
    w "You say that now, but what about the next time you don’t show up when I want you to?"
    w "The little black vibrator in my bedside drawer has been getting quite the extra workout lately thanks to you."

    "Which is fine, I guess. It’s not like I {i}expected{/i} her to when she has someone better and...less male to focus on than me. "
    "Plus, just ignoring me isn’t really being {i}mean{/i} either.  I just..."

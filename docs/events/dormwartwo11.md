    ima "Goooooood morning Vietnaaaaaam! And by Vietnam, I mean Kumon-mi because I’m realizing now that none of you understood that reference."
    ima "But that’s fine because you’ll only be paying minimal attention to me while two of our most antisocial students duke it out to see which one of them is best at being the complete opposite of themselves!"
    ima "Special thanks once again to the Produce Delivery Administration and the Tsukioka Foundation for sponsoring the event, as well as...whatever the name of Uta’s maid cafe is!"
    u "There is no need for a name when we exist in the shadows."
    ima "You say, despite the giant sign out front advertising that there is a maid cafe here!"
    u "A sign is but a symbol of what can never be."
    ima "The things you’re saying make less and less sense as the days go by so either you’re running out of steam or have suddenly become the world’s worst method actor."
    mo "Ahh, yes. Spoken like someone who has never seen Suicide Squad."
    ima "Well, apologies for having {i}taste,{/i} Molly! But before this devolves into a debate about movies, let’s get back to the method acting thing!"

    ima "Folks, being a maid is more than just ketchup and cumshots-"
    u "Not that type of cafe."
    ima "It’s about embodying the role of someone who lives for the sole purpose of someone else!"
    ima "And while it has become eerily apparent to me that that combination of words already describes a good half of you in regard to my Senpai, it’s not enough! For maids have an element of cuteness as well!"
    c "Imani, are you saying some of us aren’t cute?"

    scene maidwar3
    with dissolve

    ima "I’m saying some of you have evolved {i}past{/i} cuteness and are now extremely sexualized, anthropomorphized animals! "
    c "Aww! Come over here and let me lick you."
    ima "Do not tempt me with a good time!"
    ima "Like, seriously. These last two days have been rough."
    ima "But that’s enough of me since I’m sure you’re all raring to go!"
    ima "In just a few short minutes, both of our competitors should be ready and we can kick things off. "
    ima "So for now...sit back, relax, and enjoy the complimentary tea and breakfast!"

    "Imani’s speech comes to an end and I lean back in my chair, awaiting a day I didn’t think would ever come- seeing Maya in a maid costume."
    "Of course I’m excited to be waited on by Io as well but, apparently, she’s going to stay in her butler costume and play {i}that{/i} role instead of the traditional maid."
    "Either way, I have entrusted my wallet to Futaba for the rest of the morning so as to not tempt me into immediately emptying its contents in front of whoever goes first."
    "Which, if we’re deciding based on whoever the first one out of the locker room is, will be Io."

    scene maidwar4
    with dissolve2

    i "Morning. "
    i "Sorry for not wearing a dress. Dresses look stupid on me and make me remember that I have a vagina. Which is a thing I probably shouldn’t be saying out loud, but...anyway, hi. Io here."
    s "You seem nervous?"
    i "Yeah. I’ve got pills that are supposed to take care of that, but Uta said I’ve been taking too many lately and that they might affect my, uhh...{i}performance.{/i}"
    s "Was that supposed to sound sexual in nature or no?"
    i "No. It wasn’t. But if thinking it was brings me closer to winning, that’s fine. "
    i "Because, even if I can’t stand the vast majority of my floor, having you with me, uhh...wherever it is you wind up being forced to sleep...will sort of counteract that."
    i "Should I have sucked it up and worn the dress after all? I feel like that’s a thing I should have done. Just tell me to go get changed and I’ll do it."
    s "You’re fine the way you are. Don’t worry about it."
    i "We both know that’s a lie, but thank you anyway."
    u "Psst...the wind blows...in this general direction..."
    i "..."
    s "..."
    s "I think Uta wants you."
    i "Just ignore her. She’ll go away."
    u "PSSSSST!!!"

    "Uta pulls Io aside to, most likely, give her some form of pep talk before the competition begins."
    "Either that or the two of them have a secret, lesbian relationship with one another and Uta simply couldn’t wait to get her hands on her best friend anymore."
    "Which is fair and better than the first thing I imagined, so that’s what I’m going to go with instead."

    m "Oh, good. You’re already thinking of something disgusting and you haven’t even seen me yet. Wonderful."

    scene maidwar6
    with dissolve

    s "Stop reading my- oh boy."
    m "Yes. I am adorable. Thank you for noticing."
    s "I think you were born to wear that outfit."
    m "That’s actually very funny since wearing it makes me wish I was never born at all."
    s "I’m surprised you even agreed to this. I figured you’d just take the loss if it meant embarrassing yourself in front of me."
    m "I am not {i}embarrassing{/i} myself. Something like this is well within my capabilities. "
    m "What irritates me is the fact that I must do it for {i}you{/i} and the inevitable plethora of jokes you will make about it in the future."
    s "If I’m not too busy masturbating, you mean."

    scene maidwar7
    with dissolve

    m "You’re disgusting. But I don’t blame you. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I was aware of the consequences when I signed on."
    m "Fortunately for you, my victory will be ensured by the month worth of buffet tickets Ayane has promised me in exchange for it. "
    s "Just make sure you’re extra nice to me. I don’t like tsundere maids."

    scene maidwar8
    with dissolve

    m "You will like whatever I tell you to like and that’s final."
    s "Have you met Niki yet? Because I think you two might have more in common than you think."
    m "Yeah. Me too."

    ima "The rules are plain and simple. Whoever is a better maid...or butler...wins."
    ima "We’re going to set this up in a sort of...wheel around the service worker system. So you two will take turns getting short bursts of service in before swapping places."
    ima "We’ll be using the order you two came out of the locker room in to determine who goes first, so...Io. You’re up."
    i "Shit. What if I went back in there and then came out again? Would that put me at the back of the order?"
    u "Go, you must. And butler, you shall."
    ima "There are no strict rules determining what is and isn’t good maid-slash-butlering, so use your knowledge of Sensei to better suit his exact needs and desires."
    m "Right. But what are we supposed to do if we want to keep our clothes {i}on?{/i}"
    ima "Accept defeat, I guess? Beats me. But I ain’t judging this one! So, without further ado..."

    scene black
    with dissolve

    ima "Io...attack!"

    "Io steels herself and tries to calm her nerves. "
    "Of course, she fails miserably. But Uta is there to give her yet another pep talk (Without any secret lesbian contact, as far as I can tell) before she sighs heavily and makes her way over to my table..."

    i "It will be my pleasure to...assist you with all of your...clothed desires this fine after...morning. Not afternoon. It’s morning now."
    s "It certainly is."
    i "Could I perhaps interest you in a spot of...omelet? Or tea? Which is what I probably should have brought over here, but..."
    i "Omelet?"
    s "Sure. I was just about to order that anyway. Great predictive thinking, Io."

    scene maidwar11

    i "O...Of course, Young Master! It is my greatest pleasure to always be of clothed service to you."

    m "Hah..."
    i "Woah, it actually worked."
    s "Not to be rude, but you two are pretty fucking bad at this."
    m "Maybe you’re just a bad customer? Constantly swapping out maids and butlers like they’re socks...who exactly do you think you are?"
    s "I specifically told you I didn’t want a tsundere maid."

    scene maidwar16

    m "You did? Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry. I was just so blinded by how happy I was to see you that I must have completely forgotten."
    s "Go on..."
    m "With what? You already have your entree. My job here is done. "
    s "I mean...you could always get me a drink?"
    m "Maya out. Io in."

    scene maidwar17
    with dissolve

    i "Hi! Io again! And I brought a drink this time! Look!"
    i "That makes the score two points for Io and zero points for Maya. Do I win yet?"
    s "Go back to talking like a butler. You’re just talking like Io right now."

    scene maidwar18
    with dissolve

    i "Understood, Young Master. Of course Io would not be good enough for you. You deserve only the most attentive of servants, and I am but a lowly peon meant to do your bidding."
    i "Again, clothed."

    m "Hi."
    s "This is the worst contest yet."
    m "I actually quite like this format. It means I never have to see you for more than several seconds at a time."
    m "It’s extremely ideal for me."
    s "Would it kill you to at least {i}try{/i} and be nice?"
    m "Probably. Maya out again. Io in."

    scene maidwar22
    with dissolve

    i "Are you also starting to get dizzy?"
    s "A little. But maybe if you have a sip of the drink I didn’t order and the omelet I haven’t been able to touch yet, some of that nausea will go away?"
    i "Do you have any idea how long this has to go on for? I kind of want to sit down."
    s "Just sit here. It’s not like there’s any actual format to this contest at this point and I doubt anyone will care."
    i "Sure. That sounds good."
    i "Io sit. Maya in."

    m "You traitor."
    i "Can I get an omelet as well? And maybe some coffee?"
    m "I am not here to serve you."
    s "You’re not here to serve me either. "

    scene maidwar24
    with dissolve

    s "In fact, Io is already two points ahead of you and it’s starting to look like those buffet tickets of yours are just a pipe dream."
    m "You’ll regret saying those words to me."
    s "Will I? Because it seems to me like you {i}have{/i} to do something to redeem yourself at this point or you’re basically screwed."
    m "I am warning you..."
    i "Hey, maid girl? I still haven’t gotten my coffee and it’s been...almost fifteen seconds. So if you could hurry it up a little bit, that would be great. Thanks."

    i "Take that back! I’ll have you know that someone probably worked...moderately hard on that! But I’m not really sure as I just took it off the counter!"
    s "Beam me up, Scotty."
    m "..."

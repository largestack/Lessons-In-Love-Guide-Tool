    c "Hey! Sorry I’m late!"
    c "I had to tag along to the convenience store with Tsuneyo so she wouldn’t get lost."
    c "Do you want a drink? I brought a few back with me."
    r "Oh, no I’m fine! And it’s totally cool. "
    r "I...I wasn’t really waiting long anyway."
    c "Oh, good! I'm glad to hear that."
    c "So, what’s on the agenda for tonight?"
    c "Wanna go for a swim or something?"

    scene confession2
    with dissolve

    r "I’m actually kind of horrible at swimming, to tell you the truth."
    r "This one time, when I was little, my foster mom threw me into the pool in one of those like, “Trial by fire” sort of things where you’re supposed to learn how to swim out of fear or..."
    r "Self-preservation or something. I don’t know."

    scene confession3
    with dissolve

    r "But it like, totally messed me up and now swimming gives me anxiety and oh my God I need to stop talking."
    c "Hahahah! It’s fine! "
    c "I had no idea you were a foster kid."
    c "That’s like, another super big surprise about you."
    r "Yeah, I don’t really bring it up much. I probably would have wound up exactly the same even without them soooo yeah. "

    scene confession4
    with dissolve

    c "Any reason you decided to tell me?"
    r "Just...slipped out I guess..."
    r "I’m kind of nervous so like...I might say a bunch of stuff that’s totally weird or whatever."
    r "You can just ignore all of that."
    r "In fact, please ignore all of that."

    scene confession5
    with dissolve

    c "Why would you be nervous? No one else is even around right now."

    scene confession6
    with dissolve

    r "{i}That’s exactly what the problem is...{/i}"

    scene confession5
    with dissolve

    c "If I give off one of those...intimidating auras or whatever, just let me know."
    c "I also talk like, way more than I’m supposed to a lot of the time and...well, I don’t know if I have any crazy reveals like being a foster child-"
    c "But you can also ignore any of the weird stuff I say if that makes you feel a little more comfortable."
    r "Thanks. I’m sure that my stuff will be like, a lot more embarrassing, but that does help a little. I think. I don’t know."
    c "Hahaha~!"
    c "Hey, can we sit down?"
    c "My legs are kinda tired from the walk and we’re standing like, weirdly far apart right now."

    scene confession7
    with dissolve

    r "Oh, yeah! Totally! I like, really hate standing anyway...Yeah, sitting is good. We can sit."

    scene nightsky
    with dissolve2

    "Have you ever fallen in love?"
    "If so, I’m sorry."
    "Love is the only sickness that is socially acceptable to go out of your way to contract."
    "It makes your mind run wild, your heart beat faster, and can even drive you to the point of insanity under the right set of circumstances."
    "Yet still, we yearn for it."
    "Humans are such confusing creatures, aren’t they?"
    "Striving to be hurt. Living out their lives with only that in mind."
    "And some die miserable if they were never able to hurt as much as others."
    "None of it makes sense."

    scene confession8
    with dissolve2

    "Yet still, we yearn for it."
    "Who is it that will get hurt tonight?"

    r "Umm...Hi."
    c "Hahah~ Hey!"
    c "What’s up? Come here often?"
    r "First time this year, I think. You?"
    c "Fourth...fifth time this year, I guess?"
    c "I come with my sister and Yumi every once in a while."
    c "Even ran into Sensei on the way here a few months ago or-"

    scene confession9
    with dissolve

    c "Wait..."
    c "When...was that?..."
    r "S-Sister?..."
    r "I didn’t realize you had any siblings."

    scene confession8
    with dissolve

    c "Just {i}sibling.{/i} Singular."
    r "Older or younger?"
    c "Younger. She’s like a mini version of me."

    scene confession10
    with dissolve

    r "A mini-Chika?!"
    c "Hahaha, yup~ She’s like, totally adorable. "
    c "You wanna meet her sometime?"
    r "Yes! Yes! Yes! Please!"

    scene confession11
    with dissolve

    c "Wow, I had no idea you liked kids so much."
    r "I don’t! Normally! I think they’re horrible! But this one sounds nice!"
    r "And if she’s anything like her sister, I bet she’ll grow up to be an awesome, totally wonderful girl some day."

    scene confession12
    with dissolve

    c "Yeah..."
    c "I really hope so."
    c "I get worried about her pretty often but...she’s in good hands. "
    c "Well, mostly-good hands. Yumi’s surprisingly gentle with her."
    c "In fact, sometimes I feel like Chinami is the only person out there who’s able to get the {i}real{/i} Yumi to come out."

    scene confession13
    with dissolve

    r "Sounds like you guys are really close."
    c "You mean me and Yumi? Or me and my sister?"
    r "All three. Like a little family."
    c "Hahah~ I guess we {i}are{/i} sort of like a family. Yumi’s definitely the dad, though."
    r "I can see that. I bet you’d make a good mom, too."
    c "I hope so. "
    c "You know about {i}my{/i} mom, right?"

    scene confession14
    with dissolve

    r "Y-Yeah...It happened when we were in middle[school]. I even remember what I was wearing that day."
    r "I mean, it was on a Wednesday, so it was my[school] uniform. But still. I remember."
    r "I’m sorry if that sounded insensitive. I make jokes when I get uncomfortable sometimes and-"
    c "It’s fine. I’m not upset."
    c "I’m not gonna lie, it was really hard when she died. But it sort of forced me to step up and take on the role myself."
    c "So hearing you say I’d make a good mom makes me really happy. Thank you."

    scene confession13
    with dissolve

    r "You don’t have to thank me. I’m just telling the truth."
    c "I think you’d make a pretty good mom, too, Rin."

    scene confession15
    with dissolve

    r "Okay, now you’re just messing with me."
    c "No, no, no! That’s not it at all!"
    c "Whenever I’m around you, I just feel like you have all of this love to give and no one to really give it {i}to{/i}. You know what I mean?"
    r "Yup. That pretty much hits the nail on the head."

    scene confession16
    with dissolve

    c "But hey, if you’re ever looking to babysit, Chinami could always use some more company!"
    c "I can’t really pay you or anything, but you’d have someone to give all of that love to."
    r "You’d let me babysit your sister even though I’ve never met her before?"
    r "What if she doesn’t like me?"

    scene confession17
    with dissolve

    c "There isn’t a single person in this world who wouldn’t like you, Rin."
    c "You’re smart...you’re funny...you’re creative..."
    c "You’re a whole bunch of stuff I’ve been chasing after since I was little. And I admire that you seem to be all of those things without really trying."

    scene confession18
    with dissolve

    c "I might not seem like it, but I’m one of those people who’s always a little too concerned about what everyone else thinks about me."
    c "So I spent a lot of time refining my personality into like, this ideal sort of girl. But I can’t help but feel like that’s not really me at times, you know?"
    r "No. I don’t."

    scene confession19
    with dissolve

    c "Hm?"
    r "The Chika next to me right now is the same Chika I see in class every day. None of it's fake."
    r "You have genuine thoughts and feelings and even though you say you’re worried about what others think of you, you still go out of your way to include everyone."
    r "So that would make you brave. Braver than anyone I know."
    r "A heck of a lot braver than someone like me, at least. "
    r "Hell, before we met up I basically had a mental breakdown and had to go ask Sensei to calm me down."

    scene confession20
    with dissolve

    c "Wait, hold up. You just hit me with a lot of information all at once."
    c "Mental breakdown? Sensei? What’s going on?"
    r "A lot."
    r "A lot is going on. "
    r "A lot is always going on."
    r "And not just for me, for everybody."
    r "Which is why I think it’s so crazy how none of it ever gets to you."
    c "That’s not true...Plenty of things get to me."
    c "I just don’t let them break me because, if they do, it’s not just me that’s going down."

    scene confession21
    with dissolve

    c "I...had to grow up a little faster than a lot of other people because of my circumstances."
    c "Plus, you might be forgetting that I’m...what, like a whole year older than you? "
    r "Something like that. Maybe even closer to two."
    r "You were held back and I was bumped up. That’s pretty much the only reason the two of us ever had any classes together."

    scene confession22
    with dissolve

    c "Oh? Are you bragging now? "
    c "You better watch your tone with me since I’m like, your pseudo-upperclassman or whatever."
    r "Yes, Pseudo-Senpai. I’ll be more careful. "

    scene confession23
    with dissolve

    c "Hahah! This is really fun..."
    c "I can't really remember the last time I sat and had a solid conversation with an actual girl-friend."
    c "Like, a non-Yumi girl-friend I mean."
    c "The two of us should come here again some time."
    c "I could bring Chinami along. And Yumi would probably come around to you too with a little bit of prodding."
    c "I’m like, super glad you’re so easy to get along with. "
    r "Mhm...I’m glad too..."
    c "The moon is beautiful again tonight."
    c "I think we lucked out."
    c "It’s kind of a shame that it’s all coming to an end tomorrow morning."
    c "Before we know it, we’ll all be back in[school] and this entire trip will be nothing but a memory."
    c "I kind of wish it would last forever."
    c "Don’t you?"

    c "…"

    r "I told myself I wouldn’t cry but...holy shit, that was hard..."

    if chikadorm20 == True:
        r "Like ten times harder than getting up in front of the class and reciting that stupid poem about not being able to help who we fall in love with."
        r "But hey...full-circle and all that right? Hahahah!"

    else:
        r "Like ten times harder than anything I've ever done before."

    "That or scared."
    "Or confused."
    "It’s hard to tell on nights like this."
    "And so we cry."
    "Because that’s the only thing our bodies know how to do."
    "Cry. Cry. Cry."
    "Cry until your eyes turn red and irritated. "
    "Then wait for the pain to subside and go back to your normal life."

    c "Yeah, it’s...surprising but..."

    c "And if I’m going to do anything about it then-"
    r "Please don’t say anymore right now."

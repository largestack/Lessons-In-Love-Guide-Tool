    "With the transfer process once again out of the way, today marks the first day of the rest of Otoha’s life."
    "I decide to end my train of thought there to leave things on a positive note as I’m sure the rest of her life will be filled with turmoil and anguish."
    "Such is the life of all of us."
    "But I guess the fact that I’ve already embellished on why I cut myself off sort of defeats the purpose of cutting myself off in the first place."
    "Whoops."
    "But hey, at least now she has the entire[school] year (And every subsequent one for the foreseeable future) to keep doing the things she wants to do."
    "And her being around is sure to make Rin feel a little better as well."
    "At least for now."
    "She doesn’t have the best track record with romance, so there’s always a chance things could go sour at a moment’s notice."
    "Such is the art of never knowing."

    r "Are you excited to never learn anything again for the rest of your life?"
    o "I...highly doubt we’ll be in this class for the rest of our lives, Rin."

    "Ha."

    scene otohafirstday2
    with dissolve

    o "I do want to say thanks again for totally-not-stalking me with Nodoka the other day, Sensei."
    o "If it wasn’t for you guys, I’d probably be spending the morning reading through some boring textbook in my bedroom while my mom makes tea."
    s "Well the bedroom and the tea parts don’t sound bad. Textbooks are definitely not my thing, though."

    scene otohafirstday3
    with dissolve

    r "Sensei, be careful! If you say anything bad about textbooks, Makoto will storm out of the classroom and lecture you about it for the rest of the day."
    s "Thanks, Rin. I can always count on you to watch my back."

    scene otohafirstday4
    with dissolve

    r "Of course. That’s what homies are for, right?"
    o "It’s good knowing that you two are exactly the same inside of[school] as you are outside of it."

    scene otohafirstday5
    with dissolve

    r "What's that supposed to mean?"
    o "Not anything weird. I’m already getting used to this guy being overly friendly with [teenager]s. "
    s "I feel like those sentences contradicted each other."

    scene otohafirstday6
    with dissolve

    o "Nah. I just mean it’s cool that you’re not really focused on putting up a front or anything like that."
    o "Like that whole “Serious guy on the inside, not serious guy on the outside” kind of thing."
    s "I’m pretty sure me revealing that you’ll be getting straight A’s in perpetuity should have said all you needed to know about how I am “on the inside.”"
    o "That part’s still setting in. But yeah, definitely awesome. "

    scene otohafirstday7
    with dissolve

    if bonus == True:
        r "And don’t worry. The things he makes you do to keep your grades up are only scary the first few times."
        r "After that, it’s kind of exciting~"
        o "What...sort of things are you talking about?"
    else:
        r "And...honestly? It's kind of electrifying stabbing someone to death after you actually try it."

    scene otohafirstday8
    with dissolve

    s "Don’t listen to Rin. I don’t expect anything in return for your grades."

    if bonus == True:
        s "Though I won’t exactly reject any “donations” you’d be willing to give in exchange for them."
    else:
        s "Though, I'd definitely accept a hug or two. {i}Or a million{/i}."

    scene otohafirstday9
    with dissolve

    r "Hey! Only I’m allowed to suggest stuff like that! It sounds serious when you do it!"
    o "I’m...good."
    o "I’ll just...take the grades for nothing since you already promised that was the deal."
    s "Fair enough."
    s "Are you settled into the dorms yet or is that happening later?"

    scene otohafirstday10
    with dissolve

    o "I’m still with my parents for now, but I’ll be moving in with Nodoka by the end of the week."
    o "It wasn’t as hard to convince them to let me stay outside of the house as soon as I promised I’d be getting straight A’s from now on."
    s "Ah, so you decided not to switch with Futaba and live with Rin after all?"

    scene otohafirstday11
    with dissolve

    r "That was an option?!"
    r "I would literally die!"
    r "Platonically, of course! Definitely not because I’m so attracted to her that I would never sleep again!"
    s "Another great save, Rin."
    r "My nose isn’t bleeding again, is it?"
    r "That happened last week and I really hope it’s not going to be a recurring thing from now on."
    o "Hahah...hah..."
    o "I just figured it would make more sense to room with Nodoka since, like...I’ve known her longer and...we’re both new here and stuff."

    "That makes total sense. I’m sure Rin has absolutely nothing to do with that decision at all."

    scene otohafirstday12
    with dissolve

    r "That’s fine! I completely understand!"
    r "Besides, you’re going to be right upstairs anyway. So I’m sure we’ll still be hanging out all the time and stuff."
    r "If you’re not busy, of course. I get that you spend a lot of time practicing and...practice is...yeah."
    r "You get it."
    o "I get it."
    o "Actually, Nodoka and I will probably need some help moving stuff into our room soon if you and Futaba want to give us a hand?"

    scene otohafirstday13
    with dissolve

    r "You can have more than a hand! You can have my entire body!"
    o "…"
    r "…"
    r "I said that out loud, didn’t I?"
    o "Yup..."
    o "Just a hand is fine for now, Rin."
    r "Got it!"
    r "I’m gonna go inside the classroom and die now. Later, Otoha!"
    o "Uhh...see you in a couple minutes, Rin."

    scene otohafirstday14
    with dissolve

    s "I would once again like to apologize on her behalf."
    s "She’s just very excited to have you here."
    o "Yeah...she seems to get excited pretty easily, huh?"
    s "Lately, yeah. She goes through her rough patches, though."

    scene otohafirstday15
    with dissolve

    o "She’s told me something like that before. There’s nothing we can do to prevent it, though, right?"
    o "Like, it just kind of happens?"
    s "Probably best to just play it by ear. "
    s "I’m admittedly not great at dealing with things like that. So if you’re also ever going to get all depressed, please give me the proper notice so I don’t make things worse."

    scene otohafirstday16
    with dissolve

    o "I’ll do my best."
    o "I’m normally pretty good at handling stuff like that on my own, though."
    o "So don’t feel the need to worry about me even though you’re like...my new teacher slash guidance counselor or whatever."

    scene otohafirstday17
    with dissolve

    i "Huh? Otoha?"
    i "What are you doing here?"
    o "Oh snap, Io! Are you in this class too?"

    scene otohafirstday18
    with dissolve

    i "Yup."
    i "Sensei is awesome. I’m sure you’ll like it here."
    s "I take it you two are friends?"

    scene otohafirstday19
    with dissolve

    i "I don’t know if I’d say “friends.” Acquaintances is probably a better term. "
    i "We had a few classes together in our last[school] and Otoha is one of the few people I don’t hate for simply existing."
    o "Hooray for me."
    s "I guess your “girls are evil” stance isn’t as strong as I thought it was."
    i "Otoha is like, barely even a girl. "

    scene otohafirstday20
    with dissolve

    o "What?"
    i "She was actually super popular {i}with{/i} girls in our last[school]. Like, I’m pretty sure more girls have confessed to her than boys."
    i "I like her. Good pick, Sensei."
    s "Thanks, Io. Though it was more like Nodoka picked her than me."
    i "Either way, nice."

    scene otohafirstday21
    with dissolve

    i "I’m gonna go sit down and not talk to anyone for the rest of the day now. But it was cool catching up."
    o "Yeah. See you in class..."

    scene otohafirstday22

    play sound "slidedoor.mp3"

    o "Hah..."
    s "If it’s any consolation, I definitely view you as a girl."

    scene otohafirstday23
    with dissolve

    o "It’s weird cause like, that’s not even the first time I’ve heard that. "
    o "Like...do I come off as boyish to you?"
    s "Not so much boyish, but...maybe just really cool?"
    s "Girls tend to like people they look up to, don’t they?"
    o "I don’t know. I’ve never really liked anyone before."
    s "How? You’re in [high_school]."
    o "Well yeah, but it’s not like I’ve ever had time for a relationship or anything."
    o "And even if I did, there’s no way my parents would approve of something like that."

    if bonus == True:
        s "Well, luckily for you, your parents aren’t in charge of you anymore. And I hereby grant you permission to date anyone you want."
        o "Thanks. Try not to be too loud though because Nodoka will hear it and start bugging me again."
        s "I thought you'd be more worried about Rin hearing it."
    else:
        s "Oh, right. You have that whole conservatorship thing going on, don't you?"
        o "Yeah. It sucks."
        s "I bet."
        s "It sucks that you're not allowed to hug-"

    scene otohafirstday24

    o "Oh! Would you look at the time? Better go introduce myself to the class before the bell rings!"
    o "Good talk, Sensei! "

    s "Now pay attention to the obviously female student in the front of the class."
    o "Uh...hey, everyone. I’m the obviously female Otoha Okakura."
    o "I’m friends with a few of you already but...for those of you that don’t know me, I’m a musician and a songwriter."

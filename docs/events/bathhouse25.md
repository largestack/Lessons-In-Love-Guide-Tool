    i "Hah...Okay. I’m done working for today. You can take over now, Sensei."
    s "But I don’t know the first thing about running a bathhouse."
    i "It’s easy. Just do what I do."
    s "You mean complain and talk down on myself while watching baseball and drinking soda?"

    scene iosidesbath2
    with dissolve

    i "Yeah. Just make sure you clean the floors every once in a while and take money whenever someone tries to give it to you."

    "I find myself at the bathhouse- which is apparently now my second workplace."
    "I came here in an attempt to spend some time alone with Io but, as fate would have it, things haven’t really worked out that way thus far."
    "The second school dorm building (You know, the one where every class {i}but{/i} mine lives) has a busted water heater at the moment, meaning that everyone interested in practicing personal hygiene must come {i}here.{/i}"
    "This is not something I knew until showing up. And I really wish it {i}was{/i} because all of those girls know who I am and I can’t imagine seeing me casually hanging out with Io is a good look for either one of us."
    "Which is why, for today only, I have become an unofficial employee of the bathhouse. Though, only in name so I can tell everyone that there’s an actual reason I’m here."
    "When it comes to work, I’ve yet to do anything."

    s "What if we just close early? That’s a thing we should be allowed to do, right?"
    i "You want to close early on what has quickly become the busiest day we’ve had in years?"
    s "Kind of, yeah."
    i "Sounds good to me. Maybe you should just become an actual employee if you’re going to keep coming up with stuff like that?"
    s "I’m just applying the same strategy I use at school to this- work less, not hard."

    scene iosidesbath3
    with dissolve

    i "And what an admirable strategy that is, Sensei. "
    i "When you look at the reality of this situation, the bathhouse has already taken in far more cash than normal."
    i "Which means it should be completely acceptable to cut off that cash flow now in favor of the employees."
    s "Exactly. But also, probably don’t consider starting your own business any time soon."

    scene iosidesbath4
    with dissolve

    i "So! Now that we’re officially {i}unofficially{/i} closed, what do you wanna do? Ready for a bath yourself? "
    s "Are you just saying that because you want to see my penis again?"
    i "Nah. The novelty of your penis has worn off. It’s your ability to appeal to my inner broodiness and the fact that you actually pay attention to me that’s keeping me hooked right now."
    s "First, the novelty of my penis will never wear off. Second, your broodiness is far from {i}internal.{/i} Third, it’s hard {i}not{/i} paying attention to you when everything about you screams “Pay attention to me.”"
    i "Correction: everything about me screams “Pay attention to me, Sensei.” I couldn’t care less as far as everyone else is concerned. "
    s "Yes, you’ve made that quite apparent as well."

    play sound "entrybell.mp3"
    scene iosidesbath5
    with dissolve

    i "Oh, welcome! We’re actually closed right-"

    scene iosidesbath6
    with dissolve

    i "Ah! Yuki!"

    scene iosidesbath7
    with fade

    i "And...some other girl."
    sar "Hey! What are you doing here?"
    yu "Rockin’ the cradle, that’s what."
    s "I actually work here now."

    scene iosidesbath8
    with dissolve

    yu "You what?"
    sar "Hey, what the big deal?! How come you can work {i}here{/i} but not at my bar? "
    s "I’m sorry, Sara. It’s the name of it."
    sar "I take offense to that! That’s {i}my{/i} name too!"
    yu "You actually workin’ here now? What happened to teaching?"
    s "It’s just for today. A bunch of girls from the school are here because of some water issue, so I’m pretending to work here so it doesn't seem weird that I'm hanging out with Io."
    i "Once again, I have inconvenienced Sensei in a way that benefits me! Rejoice!"

    scene iosidesbath9
    with dissolve

    sar "Io? The girl behind you?"
    sar "I knew that you spent some of your free time with Sana and Ayane, but I didn’t realize you were going around and doing that with {i}everyone{/i} in your class."
    yu "Like I said, rockin’ the cradle. Don’t tell me you’re surprised, Sara."

    scene iosidesbath10
    with dissolve

    sar "Well, just don’t go luring them into a false state of security before impregnating them and leaving them to fend for themselves while you run off with somebody else."
    yu "Damn. If I knew you were bringin’ this much baggage, I would’ve suggested stopping at one of those coin lockers on the way over here."

    scene iosidesbath11
    with dissolve

    sar "I’m over it. And hi, Io. I’m Sara. "
    sar "I know I might look 20, but I’m actually Sana’s mom. "
    i "Sana? Do we have somebody in class with that name?"
    yu "Ignore her. She ain’t the type to really make friends."
    sar "That’s fine. Neither is my daughter."

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "Yuki pulls a wad of crumpled up bills out of her pocket before trying to hand them over to Io, only to have them shoved back in her face seconds later."
    "And seeing as none of the girls from the “main” dorm knew about the men’s side of the bath being open to the highest bidder, it’s currently unoccupied."
    "Which means that, just moments from now, Sara and Yuki will be naked together."
    "I like this and I want to participate."

    scene iosidesbath12
    with dissolve

    "However, a small green roadblock stands in my way."

    i "You guys can take the men’s side. But, just so you know, I’m closing the place up because Sensei thinks it would be best for business if the business part just...stopped."
    s "That is not what I said. But also, yes. "
    yu "Fine by me. Two’s already a crowd when it comes to shit like this."
    sar "Yuki is just embarrassed because it’s the first time she’ll be seeing my naked body."
    i "Yeah, I wasn’t talking to you."

    scene iosidesbath13
    with dissolve

    sar "Wow. Teenagers are really hard to approach now, huh?"
    yu "Ay, don’t be a bitch. Sara’s good people. She’s the one I’ve been working for. "

    scene iosidesbath14
    with dissolve

    sar "Ahh...so this is what it means to have protection from the Yakuza."
    yu "For the last time, I ain’t Yakuza anymore. I’m just Yuki now."
    i "Good. Stay “Just Yuki.” I like Yuki. This other one, I’m still not sure about. "

    scene iosidesbath15
    with dissolve

    sar "Ooh! Here’s an idea! What if we all took a bath together?!"
    i "Strike that. I’ve decided I don’t like her."
    yu "Were you not listenin’ when I just said two’s already a crowd? Three sounds even worse."
    sar "Except it wouldn’t be three. It would be four with Sensei."

    scene iosidesbath16
    with dissolve

    i "Uhh..."
    yu "Ain’t you supposed to like, {i}not{/i} encourage the whole cradle rockin’ thing? Io’s still in high school. "
    s "I’m just not going to say anything and let Sara field this one herself as I don’t want to get in trouble."
    sar "Hey, Yuki and I are just here to relax. I don’t see an issue with getting into the bath with swimsuits on. Especially since doing that would let Sensei join in on the fun as well."

    "I’m suddenly less interested, but this is still a thing I want to participate in."

    yu "Why not just leave him out of this? Ain't no reason he has to come in there with us."

    "I also don't like Yuki anymore."

    sar "Obviously because he's our friend and we don't want him to be lonely."
    yu "I mean...I guess wearin' swimsuits would solve the whole high school nudity problem, but it ain’t like either of us brought shit like that, right?"
    yu "I don’t even think I own a swimsuit."

    scene iosidesbath17
    with dissolve

    sar "Do you have any we could borrow, Io? There have to be some, like...community swimsuits, right?"
    i "Towels, yeah...swimsuits? That’s...not really a thing anyone has ever asked for before."
    i "I guess I could raid my aunt’s stuff and see if she has anything, but..."
    i "Sorry, why am I even being included in this again? "
    sar "Aren’t you closing up? I figured you’d want to unwind after a hard day of work."
    s "That does sound pretty relaxing. Working at a bathhouse is a lot more exhausting than I thought."

    scene iosidesbath18
    with dissolve

    i "You didn’t even do anything..."
    yu "You really okay with this idea? "
    s "I mean...I don’t see anything {i}technically{/i} wrong with it so long as both Io and I are covered up. But I do think it’s kind of weird no matter how you look at it since this is a bathhouse and not a pool."
    sar "What is a bathhouse if not a hot pool that people bathe in?"
    s "You should write a book. "

    scene iosidesbath19
    with dissolve

    i "I’ll, uhh...go check upstairs. But only because I do think that getting in the water sounds relaxing right now and I’m afraid that Sensei would still join you if I refused."

    "I would have."

    yu "You sure about this? I know you’re weird around girls who are like, actual girls and not {i}me.{/i}"
    i "You said she’s “good people,” so I’m trusting your word on this. But if she annoys me, which I feel like she is going to, I will not hesitate to let her know."
    sar "Thanks, Io. I’m sure you’ll have just as much fun as the rest of us."
    i "Yeah, it’s easy to say things like that when you don’t know me."
    i "Anyway...whatever. You two can just go wait in the dressing room while I flip the sign. Sensei can stay out here."
    i "I don’t want people seeing you guys standing around and assuming we’re still open. And everybody else has already paid, so..."
    i "Yeah. Bye."
    i "And don’t do anything weird while I’m gone. The cameras store footage for up to 24 hours, so I’ll know."

    scene iosidesbath20
    with dissolve

    sar "Cameras?"
    sar "Is that even legal?"
    yu "I ain’t worried. Chances are somebody out there’s already got footage of me. Doubt a little more would hurt at all."

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "I decide to do as I'm told and wait in the lobby while Sara and Yuki retreat into the men’s dressing room."
    "This lasts about five minutes before Sara, wearing nothing but a towel, walks back out into the lobby and forcibly pulls me away from my monthly good deed."
    "And while it wouldn’t be right of me to complain about an attractive grown woman’s desire to be closer to me while she’s wearing next to nothing, I can’t imagine Io will be happy to see me in there with them."

    scene iosidesbath21
    with dissolve2

    i "If I didn’t already know this was going to happen and wasn’t so dependent on your affection, I’d be really frustrated with you right now, Sensei."
    s "I tried to listen. Sara just wasn’t having it."

    scene iosidesbath22
    with dissolve

    i "Why am I not surprised?"
    sar "So, did you find anything? "
    i "Unless you want to try wearing one of {i}my{/i} swimsuits, no. I did not."
    i "Well, I did find a pair of shorts for Sensei. But it looks like you are going to have to wear your towel if you still want to carry through with this “safe for work bath time extravaganza.”"
    i "That or Sensei and I can just come in after you two are done and-"

    scene iosidesbath23
    with dissolve

    sar "Oh no! My towel has fallen off! How could this have happened?!"
    yu "Yo."
    s "Yeah, saw that coming."

    scene iosidesbath24
    with dissolve

    if sarasex == False:
        sar "And you can’t even run away this time..."
    else:
        sar "{i}Oh no. Whatever will I do now that Sensei has seen me naked?{/i}"

    s "You realize you’re just going to make this harder for me, right?"
    sar "That’s exactly what I want."
    yu "Hah..."

    scene iosidesbath25
    with dissolve

    yu "If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em."
    sar "Woo! Go Yuki! Take it off!"
    i "Uhh...hold on. Sensei’s still here. Shouldn’t you, like...maybe {i}not{/i} strip in front of him?"
    sar "I mean, {i}technically,{/i} this is {i}his{/i} side of the bath, isn’t it? "
    i "Technically, yeah. But-"

    scene iosidesbath26
    with dissolve

    yu "Can all this talkin’ stop already? I’m fucking tired."
    i "Sensei! Look away! There are too many boobs in here all of a sudden!"
    sar "And, for the first time in my life, I’m the biggest out of everyone."

    scene iosidesbath27
    with dissolve

    yu "You tryin’ to fuckin’ start something?"
    sar "Of course not! After you, Yuki. We wouldn’t want to stand here and intrude on Sensei’s personal space while {i}he{/i} gets undressed, would we?"

    scene iosidesbath28
    with dissolve

    sar "If only there wasn’t a student here...Then maybe he wouldn’t need those shorts at all."
    i "I’ve seen him naked plenty of times! We have cameras, remember?! What I {i}haven’t{/i} seen is him naked with-"
    i "Well...actually there was one time. But nothing happened then and...and..."
    i "Everybody just get in the fucking water, already!"

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "Io pushes Sara and Yuki out of the room and I get changed faster than I’ve ever gotten changed before."
    "And while it’s unfortunate that both Io and I have to keep our clothes on to preserve my image as an upstanding member of society, I {i}do{/i} understand it."
    "I’m sure that both Sara and Yuki have their...{i}suspicions,{/i} but so long as those remain nothing more than {i}suspicions,{/i} everything will be okay."
    "We can all take solace in the fact that it’s easy to ignore things you don’t want to be true. But it’s a lot harder to accept them when they are."

    scene iosidesbath29
    with dissolve2

    "For the time being, the only thing that {i}is{/i} true in all of our minds is that we’re here willingly. "
    "Some less willing than others, sure...but it’s all agreed upon even when certain aspects of that agreement have been bent and twisted out of shape."
    "This is fine because nothing is going to happen tonight."
    "And if anything does happen tonight, I’m sure {i}that{/i} would be agreed upon as well."
    "Part of me hopes something does, for my true colors would appear far less vibrant amidst the contents of several other boxes of crayons being poured into one big pile."
    "That’s just wishful thinking, though."
    "I know my colors will always stand out."
    "They’re just too dark to properly blend in with the others."

    sar "So, Io...{i}you’re{/i} the girl who’s always complimenting Yuki on her back tattoo, right? Did you know that {i}I{/i} have tattoos as well?"
    i "Yes. I found that out the moment you decided it was acceptable to strip down to nothing right in front of my teacher."

    scene iosidesbath30
    with dissolve

    sar "Want to take a closer look? Here. I got this one when I was only 17 and-"
    i "Sit down! Jesus! I don’t want a closer look!"
    sar "How about you, Sensei? Want to touch it? "
    s "Uhh..."
    yu "No one wants to see your basic ass butterfly tattoo, Sara. There are like a trillion other girls who have the same exact shit in the same exact spot."

    scene iosidesbath31
    with dissolve

    sar "Well excuse me for not having the cool Yakuza connections required to get a huge dragon tattooed across my back. "
    sar "I like my butterfly and I am proud of it. "
    yu "You don’t {i}need{/i} Yakuza connections to get shit like that. Just makes it cheaper. Got mine done for free. "
    yu "Wish I could get it finished, though. Wound up abandoning that lifestyle before I could get it colored in. Might’ve hung around a little while longer if I thought of it back then."
    yu "Ain’t no way I can afford that shit now. Not without crawlin’ back to Yumi’s prick of a dad."

    scene iosidesbath32
    with dissolve

    yu "Oh, speaking of which- you hear anything about her lately?"
    s "Yumi? I...haven’t seen her around. Why?"
    yu "Got a call the other day from some chick I used to ride with. Dude she’s seein’s the captain of the one of the Yamaguchi branches."
    yu "Told me Yumi showed up back at home the other day. First time in like a year."
    yu "Probably just needs money or some shit. But I figured you might know something about it."
    i "I wonder if it has anything to do with the fight?"

    scene iosidesbath33
    with dissolve

    yu "Fight?"
    i "Yumi kicked some girl’s ass in school the other day and hasn’t shown up ever since. It was brutal. She was unconscious and everything."

    scene iosidesbath34
    with dissolve

    yu "Get the fuck out of here. Did she really? No shit?"
    sar "Why do you look so proud? If Sana got into a fight, I’d be worried sick."
    yu "Sana’s like 50lbs soaking wet. Course you’d be worried. Yumi’s got the blood of a fuckin’ warrior. ‘Bout time she’s gotten to actually show it off."
    yu "How’s the girl she fucked up? Can she walk?"
    i "She had two black eyes for a while, but she’s pretty much back to normal now."

    scene iosidesbath35
    with dissolve

    yu "Damn. Best news I’ve heard all week. And here I was thinking I wouldn’t be able to relax with all these extra bodies around."
    i "You really haven’t heard anything, Sensei? Not even from the principal?"
    s "Nothing that everyone else doesn’t already know."
    i "Crazy. That whole situation was weird. Like, Yumi’s a dick and all, but I don’t think she’s the type to just beat the shit out of somebody for no good reason. "
    i "Nodoka had to have done something, right? What do you think it could be?"
    s "I-"
    yu "Who the fuck cares? My girl won and that’s all that matters."
    yu "Haven’t been this proud since I found out she was runnin’ her own business."
    sar "Lucky. I feel bad just asking Sana to {i}show up{/i} at mine."
    yu "Yeah, well your daughter’s a puss. Just like her mom with that basic ass butterfly tattoo."

    scene iosidesbath36
    with dissolve

    sar "Say one more bad thing about my butterfly and I will come over there and shut you up myself!"

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "Once more, I narrowly avoid having to figure out how to speak on the Nodoka issue as the conversation quickly devolves into both Yuki and Io mocking Sara for the next ten minutes."
    "Eventually, Sara {i}does{/i} get up to try and silence Yuki, but is promptly shoved underwater and forced to submit."
    "It’s around this time that Io moves closer to me and attempts to grab my hand."
    "And even though it all happens underwater, the idea of doing something like that beside two adults is enough to dissuade me from carrying through with it."
    "And yet she does not relent."
    "Each moment that the eyes are not on us is another opportunity for her to bash me over the head with her affection. "
    "But it’s affection I can only accept behind closed doors."
    "When we’re out in the open-"
    "It’s better off if I pretend that it just doesn’t exist."

    scene tsuneyointro8

    t "Thank you. "

    "Eternally grateful?..."
    "Why is she being so formal with me?"

    s "You know you can talk a little more casually, Tsuneyo."

    scene tsuneyointro9
    with dissolve

    t "Ah-"

    "Oh, shit. I’ve gotten so used to calling the other girls by their first names that I’ve forgotten that isn’t really what most people are accustomed to."
    "I guess Tsuneyo’s family is a little more traditional in nature. I’m honestly not surprised with a name as heavy as ‘Tojo.’"

    t "I’m not used to talking informally. I might make a mistake."
    s "What kind of mistake would you even make with something like that?"
    t "Who knows, bro?"
    s "…"

    scene tsuneyointro7
    with dissolve

    t "See what I mean?"
    s "Yeah, I get it. You can just stick to your normal way of speaking for now."
    s "Are you okay with me using your first name, though?"

    scene tsuneyointro6
    with dissolve

    t "Sure. A name is a name. It doesn’t make much difference to me."
    s "Cool. So, Tsuneyo-"

    scene tsuneyointro9
    with dissolve

    t "Ah-"
    s "...You’re not actually going to have an easy time adjusting to that, are you?"

    scene tsuneyointro10
    with dissolve

    t "No. It appears I am not."
    s "Well, anyway, would you mind explaining what you’re doing on the roof?"
    s "You know students aren’t supposed to be up here, right?"

    scene tsuneyointro8
    with dissolve

    t "We’re not?"
    s "Nope. It’s grounds for immediate expulsion or something like that."
    t "That sounds serious."
    s "You say that, but you haven’t moved an inch."

    scene tsuneyointro6
    with dissolve

    t "Are you going to discipline me, Sensei?"
    s "That..."

    "I really wish she wouldn’t say things like that out of nowhere."
    "I’m suddenly blindsided by an onslaught of malicious thoughts that I need to fight off in order to carry on the conversation."

    s "Discipline isn't really my style. I’m more or less curious about how you made it onto the roof."
    t "The same way you did."

    scene tsuneyointro10
    with dissolve

    t "One step at a time..."
    s "You’re not trying to sound philosophical, are you? Because if so, that was pretty bad."

    scene tsuneyointro11
    with dissolve

    t "Philosophy isn’t a strong suit of mine either."
    s "I can tell. But hey, at least you have cooking."

    scene tsuneyointro5
    with dissolve

    t "That’s right. "
    t "I will spend the rest of my life washing pork broth out of my hair."
    t "It is not a glamorous life, but it is one that I have accepted."

    "Huh..."
    "I wonder if this is one of those “I was born into my role and didn’t get to choose it” scenarios that typically arise as plot devices in TV and whatnot."

    s "Hey, Tsuneyo."

    scene tsuneyointro9
    with dissolve

    t "Ah-"
    s "How do you feel about taking over for your father?"

    scene tsuneyointro3
    with dissolve

    t "I am fine with it."
    t "I can not become a stand-up comedian, so this is the only choice I have."
    s "So your only options in life are ramen and stand-up comedy?"
    t "No. Just ramen. Comedy is off the table."
    s "Well if you ever want to expand your horizons or anything, my office is always open."

    "Now, I know what you’re thinking."

    "Me? Offering up an actual counseling session to a [teenage]girl without any ulterior motives?"
    "And to that I say-"

        "I am once again very excited to teach."

    "But at least Tsuneyo is...entertaining to talk to if not anything else."

    t "Your office?"
    s "Yeah. You...do realize I’m a teacher here, right?"
    t "…"
    s "…"
    t "I did not initially, no."
    s "So...you thought I was just some random guy on the roof asking you about your future?"
    t "Is that not common at this[school]?"
    s "Aren’t we like, halfway through the[school] year? You should know what is and isn’t common by now."

    scene tsuneyointro4
    with dissolve

    t "I have only been coming here for several weeks."
    t "I’m afraid I don’t know what is or isn’t normal yet."
    t "But if you are willing to explain things to me, I will graciously accept your assistance."
    s "Wait, you’ve only been coming here for a few weeks? Why?"

    scene tsuneyointro6
    with dissolve

    t "I was homeschooled until recently."
    t "But my father has become sick and now I must rely on Ms. Watabe."
    s "Ms. Watabe? So you know Molly?"

    scene tsuneyointro9
    with dissolve

    t "Molly?"
    s "Yeah. She just transferred to my class from Ms. Watabe’s."
    s "Irish girl. Red hair. Blue eyes. Hyper."

    scene tsuneyointro12
    with dissolve

    t "Oh..."
    t "Her..."
    s "That’s a strange reaction, but I’m pretty sure it's warranted."
    t "I was under the impression her name was...umm...what was it? Emerald Guardian of the Crystal Forest?"
    s "That’s her full name. We call her Molly for short."

    scene tsuneyointro9
    with dissolve

    t "Oh. Well then perhaps I wasn’t deceived after all."
    s "…"

    "Is Tsuneyo really this gullible?"
    "Just how sheltered is she?"

    s "Do you have any friends that you hang out with outside of[school], Tsuneyo? I can’t imagine it’s easy making them while being homeschooled."

    scene tsuneyointro5
    with dissolve

    t "I have no friends. Just noodles."

    "I can’t help but bust out into laughter at Tsuneyo’s noodle comment and spend the next several seconds trying to regain my composure..."

    s "Actually, Tsuneyo...Maybe there is hope for you in comedy after all."

    scene tsuneyointro8
    with dissolve

    t "Really? What made you change your mind?"
    s "The noodle joke was actually pretty great. Self-deprecating humor is hard to get right, but I think you hit the nail on the head."
    t "Noodle joke?"
    s "Yeah. No friends, just noodles."
    t "…"
    s "…"

    scene tsuneyointro7
    with dissolve

    t "That wasn’t a joke..."
    s "Wait, is your life really that sad?"
    t "There’s nothing sad about noodles."

    "This poor girl."

    s "I’ll be your friend, Tsuneyo. That way you won’t need to feel-"

    scene tsuneyointro13
    with dissolve

    t "No thank you."
    s "..."
    t "..."
    s "I don’t think you heard me correctly. All I was doing was offering to be your friend. I wasn’t asking you on a date."
    t "Oh, I see."
    s "So, does that mean we can-"
    t "No thank you."
    s "..."
    t "... "
    s "Mind if I ask why?"

    scene tsuneyointro4
    with dissolve

    t "I don’t exactly know the reason."
    t "I just know that my father has forbidden me from associating with any male figure that has not received his blessing."
    s "But we’ve been associating for the entire lunch period."
    t "…"

    "Tsuneyo pauses (Which is to be expected at this point) and thinks for a moment before letting out a light sigh and causing her shoulders to droop."

    t "I think this much is fine."
    t "If he asks what I did today, I can just tell him I ran into a customer."
    s "Do you report everything you do to your father?"

    scene tsuneyointro13
    with dissolve

    t "Of course. Is that not normal?"
    s "Not really by modern standards, no. But I guess it’s different from family to family."
    t "I see."
    t "Do you have any children?"

    if bonus == True:
        s "I have a [niece]. I guess she’s kind of like a daughter at times, though. "
    else:
        s "Nope. Just an accountant."

    s "You might have seen her around, actually. Her name is Ami. I’m pretty sure she has the longest twintails in the[school]. "
    t "Twintails? Are they red?"
    s "Yeah. So you {i}do{/i} know her then?"
    t "Yes. She complimented me on my skin. "
    t "No one has ever “flirted” with me before, so it stood out in my mind."
    s "…"
    s "Sorry to break the news to you, but that’s not exactly what flirting is."

    scene tsuneyointro9
    with dissolve

    t "It’s not? But she gave me a compliment based on my appearance."
    t "I already wrote her a rejection letter and everything."
    s "Yeah, I think it might be best to just hang onto that for now."
    s "Girls tend to compliment each other's appearances all the time. I think it’s a positive reinforcement thing so they can always feel validated."

    scene tsuneyointro13
    with dissolve

    t "Is that so?"
    t "Then will you tell Ami I think she has very nice legs?"
    s "I think that one’s getting a little closer to flirting territory but sure."
    t "They were very nice."
    t "She looks soft."
    s "…"

    scene tsuneyointro4
    with dissolve

    t "I wonder if she’d let me touch them."
    s "...I can ask?"

    scene tsuneyointro13
    with dissolve

    t "Thank you very much. I wasn’t sure if it was rude to ask."
    s "Not rude, just a little weird."
    t "I’ll get better in time."
    s "I sure hope so..."

    "Tsuneyo and I chat for another few minutes until the bell rings signaling the end of lunch."
    "I hang back to help her gather her things and inform her (To the best of my ability) where her next classroom is."
    "Despite seeming so cool and collected when I saw her at the restaurant, it appears that she’s a bit...aloof when it comes to[school]."
    "So the very least I can do is give her a hand when she needs it..."

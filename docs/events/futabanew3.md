    "Anything that I have convinced myself I’ve felt as of late is nothing short of cowardice."
    "Futaba Fukuyama is a naive teenage girl who is doing her best to appeal to me in ways deeper than her skin, but her skin alone is what I want."
    "I want the scent of lavender to stain my bedsheets."
    "I want my skin underneath her fingernails."
    "I want her."
    "I want her I want her I want her I want her."
    "And that is exactly why I can’t be here right now."
    "Because if the two of us remained here, I would take her with the minimal amount of force I am sure it would require."
    "I lead her out into the night in an attempt to mask my shadow with something darker."

    "But I’m not too worried."
    "Because the uncertainties inside of me have managed to fade like the dull colors of the traffic lights around us, incessantly cycling between “go” and “stop” and not offering anything in between."
    "It reminds me a little of myself, but not in a good way."
    "Lately, I have found myself getting so caught up in the depths of my mind that, sometimes, I’m shocked I’m able to crawl out at all."
    "I never know when it’s happening."
    "In fact, a lot of the time, I don’t even know when it’s over."
    "But when everything about this life is still a blur to me, even now, I can’t help but come unglued."
    "What is real?"
    "What is not?"
    "And what substance is being used to keep me grounded? Because it is very clearly not working if I’ve managed to make even Futaba uncomfortable tonight."

    s "Can I ask you something, Futaba?"
    f "Of course. Though...it’s a little worrying to have you {i}ask{/i} to ask me rather than just ask me outright."
    s "Are you scared of me?"
    f "Scared?"
    s "This isn’t normal...Coming to your room in the middle of the night and standing outside your door...Dragging you with me to some part of town I’ve never even seen before..."
    s "And all for nothing, too."
    f "It’s not nothing, Sensei. You didn’t want to be in the dorms, right?"
    f "And I’m assuming...you didn’t want to be at home either."
    f "I don’t know if I’m just the lucky one who managed to open her door and find you first tonight, but..."
    f "I’m not scared of you."
    s "Well, you should be."
    f "Why do you say that?"
    s "I don’t know."
    s "I just think that you’re supposed to be scared of me."
    f "Hmm...Well, I don’t think that’s a very compelling reason. So I think I’ll just remain unafraid, if that’s okay with you."
    s "What will it take to make you scared of me?"
    f "You’re starting to sound like you {i}want{/i} me to be scared of you."
    s "I...don’t think that’s the case. "
    s "I just don’t understand why you...or anyone else for the matter, is just {i}okay{/i} with me doing the things I do when they’re so clearly wrong."
    f "I think...the answer to that might be a little more boring than you expect, Sensei."
    f "We simply...don’t think the things you do are wrong."
    s "Then you’re all just as lost as I am."
    f "Maybe we are..."
    f "But we trust and respect our guide."
    f "And...I may not be able speak for anyone else...but I don’t think that part of me will ever change."
    s "..."
    f "I might not be the type of heroine you’d enjoy to read about in a story, Sensei..."
    f "But..."
    f "I think I make a pretty good supporting character."

    "We make our way up the incline and disappear down an alleyway because even the light of the moon is too bright for me to properly hide right now."
    "I don’t understand Futaba at all. I don’t understand why she’s okay with me or why she’d even go as far as calling me her {i}guide{/i} when I am merely one dark passage away from stealing something precious to her."
    "There are no cars this late at night. None near us at least."
    "Everything is perfectly silent apart from Futaba’s boots making contact with the ground."
    "It gets colder as we get higher."
    "I haven’t felt a chill like this in a long time."

    f "Huh...I think we’re actually getting kind of close to one of the edges of Kumon-mi..."
    s "We’re not in some sort of...restricted area or something, are we?"
    f "Have you never seen the barrier up close before, Sensei?"
    f "I went with a friend of mine once. We wrote our given names on the wall just last year...right before I started high school."
    s "Is this the same friend I’ve heard you talk about before?"
    f "It is. And it’s probably safe to assume she’s the one I’m talking about whenever I don’t say “Rin,” since those two are basically my only good friends. "
    f "Unfortunately, the part we wrote on is miles away from here. And, honestly, I don’t even know if I’d be able to find it or if...these walls are ever cleaned."
    s "Should we write our names on the wall as well?"

    scene anotherfutabaevent13
    with dissolve

    f "Maybe. Come to think of it...I don’t even know your real name."
    s "I’d just write “Sensei” anyway. As far as I’m concerned, that {i}is{/i} my name."
    f "Do you really want to go? It’s {i}really{/i} big up close. But I guess that’s to be expected since the whole point is to isolate us in the first place."
    s "Not to be a downer, but a trip to a giant wall doesn’t sound like much fun. I was just kidding about writing our names down anyway."

    scene anotherfutabaevent14
    with dissolve

    f "I guess I’m just a little gullible then."
    f "But, um...if we’re {i}not{/i} going to keep going until we reach the end...would you mind if we took a little break soon?"
    f "It goes without saying, but...I’m not really...um...one of the {i}fittest{/i} girls in the class and...we’ve been walking for a while now."
    s "Sure. We’ll stop at the next bench we see and head back home after that."

    scene anotherfutabaevent13
    with dissolve

    f "Are you okay with that? Going home, I mean."
    s "Of course. I’m completely fine."
    s "I just felt like walking tonight...and what better place to walk than some random, dimly lit area near a giant wall?"
    f "Heheh...right. What better place indeed."

    "Alley after alley, light after light...our journey continues and somehow manages to grow even colder than I had mentioned it being just moments ago."
    "I guess that even summer has nights like that."
    "Despite the drop in temperature, I am never once tempted to reach for Futaba’s hand and warm it using my own."
    "I’m tempted to do plenty of other things of course...and perhaps I even would if it were not for the infectious smile that she’s yet to abandon even once since setting out into the night with me."
    "Maybe I {i}do{/i} want her to fear me?"
    "Maybe the fear is what compels me to act at all?"
    "And maybe, if I can wipe that smile off of her face-"
    "I can spare her from the agony I am sure she will endure because of me."
    "Maybe not tonight."
    "Maybe not the next."
    "But one day, everything around her will come crashing down."
    "And chances are...when she looks up...I will be towering over her and the remnants of all that she loves."
    "With a hammer in one hand-"
    "And the base of my cock in the other."

    "She books us a ride back to the dorm on her phone, using money her parents sent her so she can perform a sexual favor for her teacher in the comfort of her own room."

    no "What does she know?! What does she know and why will she not tell me?! "

    s "I’m fine, thanks. "
    no "Are you sure? It’s {i}really{/i} good. And if you stare into it beneath the ceiling lights, you can kind of see your reflection."
    no "Reflections carry hints, you know? Like shadows. Hints that we can use to discover the truth about all of this."
    no "What makes the world move? Is it the sun? Or is it the strings of a puppeteer pulling us toward a giant ball of hot fucking lava that will one day consume us all?"
    s "It’s-"
    no "Bzzzzzt. The answer is the sun. You’re a teacher. You should know this. But it would be really fucking cool if it was something else, right?"
    s "Uhh..."
    no "So anyway, reflections. Mirrors. Reflections in mirrors."

    no "It’s technically possible if we pause reality when all of its atoms are aligned. I can probably time it if you have the supernatural ability to stop time."
    no "Is that something you have? That’s something I think you have."
    s "Me? No. But there’s a girl on the first floor who-"
    no "Good! Go get her. Fetch the girl. Bring her here and make her stop time so that I may spend the rest of it searching for the one that I am after."
    s "It doesn’t really work that way. Also, if you spend your days chasing after someone you saw in a dream, chances are you’re going to die alone and unfulfilled."

    no "That’s why I asked you to stop time, you fucking nuisance! Are you even listening to me?! "

    "So, it’s good that Nodoka’s pants are off. Don’t get me wrong. "
    "But it would be much better if her pants were off {i}and{/i} she was being nice to me- which is very much not the case so far."

    no "Stop thinking to yourself! Share your thoughts with me! "
    s "I was just thinking that I’m glad your pants are off, but that I wish you were nicer to me."

    s "What? "
    no "We have to go on an adventure! We have to uncover the thing in the thing! The one I need for the thing!"
    s "What thing? "
    no "The fucking {i}thing,{/i} Sensei! Do you need me to spell it out for you?!"
    no "Thing! T-H-I-N-G! Thing!"
    no "Come! Now! To the outside world! A large wooden structure awaits us!"
    s "Are you at least going to put on pants first?"
    no "Pants are for the weak! I think better without them! If anything, you should also remove your pants!"
    no "We should go on a pantsless adventure and fuck inside of a mirror!"
    no "If you can figure out how to get in, I’ll let you into {i}me!{/i} I’m serious! It would be a fair trade! A tight fit, sure! But I can handle the pain if it means bringing me one step closer to the other side!"
    s "Nodoka-"
    no "Adventure! Penis! Mirror! Eyes! Now!"
    s "I’m good. You can go without me. I don’t really want to risk being seen out in public with a bottomless teenager who looks like she’s on drugs."

    no "So good for digging! Digging to find what’s buried beneath our feet! "
    no "It is there! I can hear it! I can feel it! It flops around like a fish! A fish with hooks for eyes! A hook with a fish for a mouth!"
    no "Let’s find the fish, Sensei! Let’s catch it and cook it! I’m a detective! I know what I’m talking about!"
    s "Just to confirm, you aren’t {i}actually{/i} on drugs, are you? Because I’m beginning to feel a little skeptical."
    no "No drugs for me! Just thoughts I am infected with! The thoughts of someone else! A second me! One we must collect and dissect!"
    no "Turn around! Face the door! Open it! And walk in a direction you seldom walk in! This is how we find it! This is how we uncover the truth!"

    "You know, all of that time I’ve spent with Yasu recently is beginning to feel pretty normal by comparison. "
    "It may be {i}consistently{/i} more odd being around her, sure...but the thing with Nodoka is that when she’s off, {i}she is off.{/i}"
    "And as she forces me out of her bedroom by pushing against my back with all of her strength, I can’t help but wonder if she is acting on behalf of some sort of higher power as well."
    "I doubt she is, for she seems far too logical to involve herself with such matters."
    "But whatever is causing this must be far more than the shifting of chemicals inside of her brain."

    no "Then it must be a clue. There must be a reason I came here. There must be a reason I don’t know where I am. And there must be a reason you are here with me."
    s "I’m just here to prevent anything from happening to you as you are a teenage girl wandering around in the middle of the night in her underwear."
    no "Stop fucking lying to me. I know you’re just waiting for me to fall asleep so you can take them for yourself. Is that it? You want my underwear? "
    no "Or do you truly want to help me with my mission?"
    s "And...what’s your mission again? Something about digging?"

    scene nodokacrazy12

    no "More than just digging! Digging is just one of several means of accomplishing it!"

    no "Dig! Dig dig dig!"

    "Nodoka storms off, but her voice remains all around me as it echoes throughout an old and unfamiliar school yard."
    "Her shirt gets caught on a bush that she decides to walk {i}through{/i} instead of around."
    "I don’t worry about whether or not there were any thorns that may have cut her exposed legs open."
    "I just think about how fortunate I would be if they were to tear her shirt instead and force her into an even greater state of defenselessness. "

    no "Why are you not helping?! We have a job to do!"

    no "There are so many books! So many books and yet I have read them all! We need more books! We need more groceries! Plates of gray food and lavender hair! "
    no "Triangle! Circle! Triangle!"

    "Okay, so Nodoka is officially broken. But at least she is broken in a position that I have imagined her in several times in the past."
    "I kind of always figured I’d be behind her in a different way once her back arched, though."
    "I can’t say many of my sexual fantasies involve a girl filling the space between her fingers and her nails with dirt."
    "I also can’t say that I have any idea how to deal with this. So, at the risk of Nodoka {i}actually{/i} digging until there is no skin left on her fingers, I should probably call on someone for help."
    "Someone who may or may not have experience dealing with this girl in her manic state. And someone not named Otoha since she normally just bails."

    "Unfortunately, I am physically incapable of willing myself to do this. So I watch as she waves it back and forth, throwing dirt behind her as she continues to dig."
    "Why am I not helping her, you ask? "
    "Because I don’t want to."
    "Because I’d rather observe."
    "It’s what Nodoka does best, so I think having her on the opposite side of things for once could be good for her."

    no "It’s close! So close! I can feel it! I can smell it! And all without your FUCKING help, you useless piece of meat!"
    s "Good job, Nodoka. Hard work pays off, doesn’t it?"
    no "What do you know about hard work?! What do you know when all you do is stand in the corner of the room and dream of the day when you can make a mountain of our bodies?!"
    s "My fantasies aside, Futaba is on her way over so the two of us can drag you back to the dorm."

    "I wake up in a room with clocks."
    "None of them have hands, but they still find the {b}TIME{/b} to tick in different increments."
    "My eyes depart from the unclothed body of a small girl in the corner of the room and land on the arms of a chair that I’m currently strapped to."
    "The wood is rotted and warped."
    "Small, white insects emerge from the holes covering it and crawl up my sleeves, biting chunks out of my arms with their tiny bug teeth."
    "They’re probably termites."
    "I am no expert when it comes to insect identification, I just can’t think of any other bugs off the top of my head that live inside of wood and enjoy biting things."

    scene newroom2

    "An image appears in the corner of the screen containing a termite queen."
    "It has a head, several legs, and a large white part bloated beyond belief with enough eggs to provide enough termites for everyone."
    "One of them is somewhere inside of me."
    "I know this because with each strip of flesh peeled from my arms by the spawn of the termite queen, I see myself beginning to morph into wood."
    "Soon, I will be a home for millions of bugs. And it’s all thanks to the giant, white egg sack."
    "Thank you, giant white egg sack."
    "Thank you, termite queen."

    scene newroom1

    "The graphic disappears and I’m left alone in the room with the girl and the clocks again."
    "I stare at her ass."
    "It’s a good ass."
    "I want to touch it but, unfortunately, I am almost entirely wood now."
    "What I mean by that is I have an erection."

    "The girl comes closer and I can’t see her ass anymore."
    "At the same time, the termite queen emerges from the left leg of my pants and begins to crawl up the right leg of the girl in front of me."
    "Well, I guess it’s not really crawling since it is so hilariously engorged with eggs that it can’t even move on its own anymore."
    "Instead, a large group of worker termites pushes it up the girl’s body, tearing off bits of her flesh along the way. "
    "Within seconds, each bite swells and turns yellowish-white. "
    "Eventually, the termites are able to push their queen to the girl’s mons pubis."
    "I will show you what this is."

    "Never mind. The camera {s}angel{/s} angle fucked up so we can’t really see it from here."

    scene newroom5

    "It’s up there somewhere, I think."
    "Anyway, the termite queen is pushed inside of the girl and she gyrates her hips a little to let it inside."
    "She’s probably done this before."
    "I wonder if the termites also bite off parts of her insides as well. And, if so, I wonder how long it will take to hollow her out."
    "I have always wanted to do sex inside of a hollow girl. There is more room for cum that way."

    scene newroom4

    "The arrows are removed as it is no longer time to talk about termites or the mons pubis."

    six "Welcome to the {s}edge{/s} end of the world. "
    six "Are you enjoying the show?"
    s "Not really. It’s suddenly very hard to breathe and all I can see is your vagina. "
    six "Does it look nice up close?"
    six "It belongs to you."
    six "The whole {b}WORLD{/b} belongs to you."
    six "Doesn’t this view make you want to insert things inside of me?"
    six "Doesn’t this view remind you that {b}GOD{/b} is real?"

    "The penis attached to my body gets harder and the last few termites inside of me finally make their exit and drop to the floor before melting away with a slight hissing noise."
    "I use this opportunity to try and break free from the rotting chair, but moving my limbs at this point in time is all but impossible as paralysis begins to set in."
    "I fight against my body’s executive decision to take back control because the idea of being stuck here forever worries me."
    "It is at this time that the tide is shifted in my favor."
    "I finally begin to make progress."
    "The wood cracks each time I move my arms. But the downside is that each time I do this, my mouth begins to fill up with fluid."
    "It isn’t until my molars are gone that I realize the fluid is my teeth being liquefied, which now means I have to worry about the liquid rehardening once it slides down my throat."
    "I try to keep my mouth still so my teeth will harden back into their original shape, but teeth taste surprisingly bad so I wind up gagging a little."

    scene newroom6
    with dissolve2

    "The walls of the girl’s opening begin to spread apart."
    "It must be mating season."

    six "Would you like to touch it?"
    s "Yes. But alas, I am chair."
    six "All you have to do is move a little more."
    six "Struggle harder and the prize will be yours."
    six "Your life will be a sea of troubles from this point on. Learn to swim or drown in misfortune."
    six "The choice is yours."

    "Feeling inspired, I begin to move my arms again."
    "Within moments, I can feel myself being freed."

    scene newroom7
    with dissolve2

    "I twist my body and finally manage to make it out of the chair, taking a celebratory bite out of the young girl’s clitoris once I do."
    "She jumps due to either a good feeling or a bad feeling, but if she lets termites inside of her, I imagine it’s good."
    "My bite can’t be any worse than theirs, especially since I don’t even have molars anymore."

    scene newroom6
    with dissolve

    "I drop to the floor and stare at the sky as vaginal secretions begin to drip onto my face like acid rain."
    "I am soon joined by several friends."

    scene newroom8
    with dissolve2

    "It appears that several spiders have also been making themselves at home inside of this girl’s pussy."
    "I am surprised that they are still able to move with how wet and sticky and weighed down by girl-juice they are."
    "I wonder if they met the termites."

    "I figure that if I masturbate hard enough, I might be able to ejaculate onto her body from here."

    six "何で?"
    six "何で? 何で? 何で?"
    six "家に帰りたい。"

    "Her voice reminds me of the moon and only makes me want her more."
    "It is a shame that she ended up the way she did, swinging back and forth between two large, wooden t’s with carved out melons beside them."
    "This could all have been prevented if only I did not decide to knock on Dorm #5."
    "How am I going to explain to that girl with the red hair that some other girl died in a room full of clocks and that I proceeded to pleasure myself to her before even taking her body down?"

    s "You mean the spiders and the termite queen?"
    six "I mean various types of thick juices and walls of flesh."

    te "Meanwhile, girls have an entire chunk of their bodies taken out and are punished by {b}GOD{/b} every month for not being men by floods of mucus and blood and uterine lining that we have to soak up with cotton."
    te "Are you following along, [[redacted]?"
    s "..."
    te "Great!"
    te "So, because you are a big strong man in a position of power who wants nothing but to make his special sex organ feel good, you can do sex to whoever you want!"
    te "Except for that fucking whore with the ponytail and the watermelon fetish. You can do better than her."
    s "..."

    te "Did you know that recreational incest dates back to the very beginning of sex itself?"

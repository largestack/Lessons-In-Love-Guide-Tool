    s "Hm?"

    "My phone goes off in my pocket and I quickly remove it to see who has the audacity to contact {i}me{/i} first when I’m the one that makes the decisions here."
    "And, of course, it just so happens to be the one person I have more trouble saying no to than anyone else."

    play sound "phonebeep.wav"

    "I tap on the call button next to her name on my lock screen and wait to see if she picks up."

    a "Hi!"
    s "Hey. What do you need?"
    a "What do you mean “What do I need?” "
    s "I mean you literally just texted me saying that you need me."
    a "I need you in order to survive, of course!"
    a "I’d be lost without you, Sensei."
    s "That’s cute and all, but please don’t text me saying you need me if it’s just going to be something vague like that."
    a "Wait, hold on. That’s not the only reason I texted you. I actually {i}do{/i} need something."
    a "Well...{i}we{/i} need something."
    s "We?"
    a "Mhm! A few of the other girls are here to spend the night."
    s "Oh, right. It’s Saturday."
    s "Are you going to ask me to buy you snacks again or something?"
    a "Thank you, Sensei! I love you!"
    s "Ami, I-"

    play sound "phonebeep.wav"

    s "…"

    "When and how did I become a slave to a short, red haired girl who still has to put whipped cream on pancakes in order to eat them?"
    "And why do I so typically have no problem dropping everything I’m doing to go see her?"
    "Not that I was really doing anything right now to begin with, but..."
    "You get the point."
    "I sigh to myself as I change directions and head to the nearest convenience store, wondering who showed up to the house tonight and who didn’t."
    "It’s something I probably should have asked beforehand to figure out how much to buy and-"

    s "Oh."
    s "Welp, looks like that’s out of the question."

    "………"
    "……"
    "…"

    a "Welcome home, Sensei. Did you pick up enough snacks for everybody?"
    s "I picked up absolutely nothing."
    a "Do you..."
    a "Do you not love me anymore?"
    s "Do you measure my love for you in junk food?"
    a "Not entirely but it’s a good way to get an understanding of it."
    s "I’m out of cash. You guys are just going to have to live with what we have here."
    s "Where’s everyone else?"

    scene mollyslumber2
    with dissolve

    mo "Valhalla, I presume."
    mo "It seems that everyone mysteriously had things come up today and the rest of the club members couldn’t make it."
    a "Yeah...it’s kind of hard to call it a manga club slumber party when only two of us are actually in the club."
    s "No Ayane either? She always comes to these sorts of things."

    scene mollyslumber3
    with dissolve

    a "She said she wasn’t feeling well."

    "Again? "
    "Didn’t she say she was going to stop doing that?"

    s "And Sana still came?"

    scene mollyslumber4
    with dissolve

    sa "I...can do things on my own..."
    sa "And...Ayane...insisted that I come so she could be alone..."
    s "Huh..."
    s "Well, good for you. "
    mo "I know firsthand how dangerous it can be going into a dungeon underleveled, but just look at all of us as a generous party that is going to carry you through it and hand over all the loot!"

    scene mollyslumber5
    with dissolve

    sa "Um...thank you..."
    sa "I’ll be okay, though..."
    sa "It’s...easier when we’re just playing games and...it looks like that’s all we’ll be doing tonight anyway..."
    a "We would have been eating potato chips too if Sensei still loved me."
    s "What is Tsuneyo doing, though?"

    scene mollyslumber6
    with dissolve

    mo "What do you mean, Sir? She’s a valued member of the party and is having just as much fun as the rest of us."
    t "Am I being kicked out?"
    s "I just meant that she’s the only one without one of those Gameboy things."

    scene mollyslumber7
    with dissolve

    mo "{i}Gameboy{/i} things?! What year do you think it is, Sir?!"
    s "How the Hell am I supposed to know what it’s called? I haven’t played a game in...I have no idea how long, actually."
    s "Maybe never."

    scene mollyslumber8
    with dissolve

    a "That’s not true! You used to play Mario Kart with me and Ayane every time she slept over at first!"

    scene mollyslumber9
    with dissolve

    a "Wait...now I’m just sad that she’s not here..."
    t "Am I supposed to have one of the “Gameboy things?” to fit in?"
    s "I don’t know. Probably. "
    s "I just figured you were bored sitting around while everyone else plays."
    t "I’m actually enjoying watching the Emerald Guardian play. "
    t "My fingers were created for noodling, not video games."
    t "I could not fathom pulling off the techniques she uses."
    mo "There are simply some people out there who just prefer watching games over playing them, Sir. It’s a totally normal thing."
    mo "I do wish Tsuneyo would express a bit more interest in playing herself at times, but doing so would require a fourth Switch and we only have three between all of us."
    s "Wait, who are you switching with? What does that mean?"

    scene mollyslumber10
    with dissolve

    mo "Come on! Stop pretending to be older than you actually are!"
    sa "The...“Gameboy thing” is...called a Switch, Sensei..."
    sa "It’s not...an actual Gameboy..."
    s "Well, whatever it is, feel free to make yourselves at home."

    if bonus == True:
        s "And if that requires taking off some of your clothes in order to do so-"
    else:
        s "And if that involves jumping on my bed...so be it. Just be careful because the springs are old."

    scene mollyslumber11
    with dissolve

    a "Uhh...better idea! How about you...go make us dinner or something?"
    s "Me? Make dinner? "
    s "You four haven’t been drinking, have you?"
    t "You would know if I was drinking. It would not be pretty."
    mo "Aye. You’d be sure to know with me as well."
    sa "And...umm...it's embarrassing but...me too..."
    s "Okay, so you three have very distinct drunk personalities."
    s "But Ami, on the other hand..."

    scene mollyslumber12
    with dissolve

    if bonus == True:
        a "I’m a good girl and stay away from alcohol."
    else:
        a "I think alcohol tastes like grass, so I am never going to drink. Also-"

    a "How am I supposed to be there for you if I can’t see straight or walk or do the alphabet backwards?"
    s "There aren’t many situations where being there for me would require a backwards alphabet, but thank you for keeping an eye out."
    s "I’m still not making dinner, though."
    t "I’ll do it."

    scene mollyslumber13
    with dissolve

    mo "Ah! Right! "
    mo "The Kendo Princess was leveling her cooking while the three of us were mastering the blade!"
    t "I mastered the blade a long, long time ago."
    t "Now, I fight with flavor."
    a "I forgot you could cook, Tsuneyo. That sounds great."
    a "Are you sure you’re okay with it, though? It feels kinda rude to make you cook for us at a slumber party instead of just making Sensei do it."
    t "I would never eat anything this man prepared for me. I will do it myself."
    s "I can’t even be offended by that because it’s just good judgement."
    sa "Do you...need any help?..."
    sa "I’m...not very good at cooking but...I’ve...harvested a lot of vegetables in games and..."
    sa "Actually...I’d...probably just get in the way..."

    scene mollyslumber14
    with dissolve

    t "Yes. You probably would."
    t "I can handle it on my own. I would just need to familiarize myself with where you keep everything before I start."
    a "You’re capable of at least giving Tsuneyo a tour of the kitchen...right, Sensei?"
    a "You help me get stuff off the top shelf all the time, so even if you don’t ever cook or clean, you should know where everything is by now."
    s "If this is what gets me out of cooking, fine."
    s "Come on, Tsuneyo. Let’s let these three race go karts and...harvest vegetables or whatever on their own."
    mo "Does racing go karts from the comfort of a friend’s couch not sound fun to you at all? "
    a "I can remind you how to play later if you want. I think it would be fun bonding like that again."
    s "We’ll see. But for now, I have a tour to give."
    s "Tsuneyo, up."

    scene mollyslumber15
    with dissolve

    t "You will speak to me like a human female and not a dog."
    s "Tsuneyo, will you please accompany me to the kitchen?"

    scene mollyslumber16
    with dissolve

    t "Yes. I appreciate you asking so politely."

    scene black
    with dissolve

    "I exit Ami’s room, holding the door open for Tsuneyo as she gracefully gets off of the floor and heads for the kitchen."
    "It’s easy to overlook it in[school] since everyone is sitting down most of the day, but Tsuneyo’s height is definitely not anything to just...write off."
    "She’s only a few inches away from matching me and, given how short everyone else is around her, it’s actually a bit captivating in a weird sort of way."
    "It’s no exaggeration to say that she stands out. And it’s interesting that the time I seem to notice it most is when she’s right here in my home."
    "Maybe it’s just because I’ve grown so used to the rest of the sights here..."
    "But I’m finding it a lot harder than usual to keep my eyes off of her."

    t "Sensei?"
    s "Hm?"
    t "I’m waiting for you to show me where you keep everything."
    s "Oh, right. Sorry."

    "………"
    "……"
    "…"

    scene mollyslumber17
    with dissolve

    "I do my best to point out where everything is and get surprisingly little wrong based on how infrequently I open any of the cabinets and drawers here."
    "Regardless, Tsuneyo takes everything in with what seems like photographic memory or...cooking sense or something."
    "The same sense that helps people like Rin remember the names and ingredients of like six million drink recipes without batting an eye."
    "People like that are amazing."
    "People that can cook are amazing."
    "People that can do {i}anything{/i} are amazing."
    "…"
    "What can I do?"

    t "You may sit, if you’d like. It is your home, after all."
    s "Ehh, I’m fine standing here and watching. "
    s "I’ll view it as a sort of “Tojo Ramen on the go” special."

    scene mollyslumber18
    with dissolve

    t "It would be hard to profit off of such a venture."
    s "Well you’re free to move in and work in shifts with Ami to lighten a bit of the load on her."
    t "I can not abandon my father in his time of need."
    s "Oh, right. That’s a thing."
    t "He has been more active than normal lately."
    t "He’s still unable to get out of bed, but his smile has returned."
    t "If I were to leave him now to take up a job in an unknown man’s house, I imagine it would fade very quickly."
    s "I’m not “unknown.” I’m your teacher."
    t "That makes little difference to him. "
    t "He was kind enough to allow me out of the house after so many years. Asking him for more on top of that would make it seem like I am not grateful."
    s "You’re grateful to someone who kept you locked away for your entire life?"

    scene mollyslumber19
    with dissolve

    t "I am grateful to someone who taught me how to read and write."
    t "Who washed my hair when I was a child and bandaged my fingers when I cut myself in the kitchen."
    t "Who tenderly explained to me why our skin colors didn’t match and why people always looked surprised to find out I was his daughter."
    t "My father is a good man."
    t "I wish there were more people who would see him that way."

    "Tsuneyo pauses for a moment, likely waiting for me to say something."
    "Unfortunately, I don't have anything important or insightful to add, so I simply remain quiet and allow her to continue getting whatever point she's trying to make across."

    scene mollyslumber20
    with dissolve

    t "Sensei..."
    t "You love Ami, correct?"
    s "I mean...she {i}is{/i} my [niece]."
    t "If she was in danger and it was within your power to protect her...but it meant confining her to this very house...would you do it?"
    s "In danger from what exactly?"
    t "What is something you fear?"
    s "I don’t know...just make something up for me."
    t "Fine."
    t "Let’s say it’s spiders."
    t "An endless supply of them."
    t "Spiders that she’s highly allergic to. Ones that will kill her if they so much as sink their fangs into the pale skin of her beautiful legs."
    s "You really like her legs, don’t you?"
    t "They remind me of these carrots. Tender and soft."
    s "Are they...still good? Because you can throw them away if they’re not."
    t "They will suffice."
    t "But...if you could save your [niece] and preserve your love for her by confining her to this house, what would you do?"
    s "I..."
    s "I don’t know. That’s kind of a weird question."

    scene mollyslumber21
    with dissolve

    t "It is, isn’t it?"
    t "If I were Ami, I’d want to be saved."
    t "There’s nothing more important than preserving one’s own life."
    s "Not even noodles?"
    t "There is {i}almost{/i} nothing more important than preserving one’s own life."
    t "If protecting the person you love means sacrificing their freedom, all you need to do is teach them to feel free in captivity."
    t "I could have lived my entire life in Tojo Ramen without the desire to leave."

    scene mollyslumber22
    with dissolve

    t "But..."
    t "Sometimes, I’m glad I was able to."

    s "That’s just-"
    s "You know what, nevermind. I’m gonna take this."
    s "I’ll be in the living room if you need anything."

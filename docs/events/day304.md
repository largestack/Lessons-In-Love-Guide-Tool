    to "No! It was one of the worst nights of my life!"
    to "How do I return her? Do you still have the receipt?"
    s "I didn’t {i}buy{/i} her, Touka. And most human traffickers don’t accept returns. "

    to "This is no time for fun and games, Sensei. This demon is clearly out to get me."
    s "Is she? Because she looks pretty harmless right now. Especially with you being able to drag her around the hall."
    ya "Touka is right when she says that I kept her up very late, but it was not my intention to do that."
    ya "I have to pray for at least four hours every night before I’m able to close my eyes. And I did not want to pray in the hall."
    s "Well, can you promise to...pray quieter next time or something?"
    ya "I can promise to try."

    s "Hey, for all you know, Yumi could be even more religious than Yasu is. "
    ya "All I want is to be friends, Touka...I’m sorry if I upset you."

    scene yasutoukahall5
    with dissolve

    to "You don’t understand the first thing about friends, Yasu! Friends let each other {i}sleep!{/i}"
    s "To be fair, you don’t really understand the first thing about friends either, Touka."
    s "You and Yasu probably just need to bond."
    ya "Sensei is right. If we are going to be successful roommates, we should first learn to deal with each other’s flaws."

    scene yasutoukahall6
    with dissolve

    to "Hmph! Luckily for you, I don’t have any flaws. So your job should be quite easy."
    ya "That’s right, Touka. You’re the perfect, ideal woman and I am but a worm wriggling desperately on the ground beneath you, praying to not be stepped on."

    to "Wait...There’s no need to be that harsh on yourself. "
    s "Weren’t you calling her a demon like, one minute ago?"
    to "Yes, but that’s before she began self-deprecating. "
    to "Mother told me that I can not be putting myself above others, and having Yasu refer to herself as a worm beneath my feet makes me feel as if I may have failed."
    ya "I am not even worthy of the bacteria crawling off of your fingertips onto the collar of my shirt."

    scene yasutoukahall8

    to "Well...no. But I-"
    ya "It’s okay, Touka...Even if you cast me out into the hall for my nightly prayer, I won’t think any less of you."
    ya "I do want the two of us to get along. So if exiling me is what you believe must be done for that to happen, I shall gather what little belongings I have and flee forever."
    s "How exactly would exiling yourself help you two get along?"

    scene yasutoukahall10

    ya "Our physical forms are not the only way our thoughts can connect with one another."
    ya "If Touka and I close our eyes at the exact same time and utter the third verse of [[redacted], our thoughts will connect and our minds will become one until the sun next rises."
    to "Yasu, this is precisely why I do not think it is possible for us to get along."
    to "I don’t understand the first thing about your...religion. And I fear that even attempting to do so would lead to me becoming even more of an outcast than I already am."

    scene yasutoukahall11

    to "No! And I do not want her to!"
    ya "You remember!"
    s "Yeah. I have a hard time forgetting things that scary girls yell at me in the middle of the night."
    ya "I am not scary, Sensei. What is scary is the thought of living in perpetual misery and fear, far off in the looming darkness and covered in wires."

    "I zone out for a moment due to boredom, but quickly return to my senses as zoning out in front of my students is rude."
    "I must pay more attention."

    to "I suppose all I’m saying is that...I wish you’d be a bit more predictable."
    to "I, too, know what it is like to be thrust into new situations without so much as a warning..."
    to "But I feel that the manners in which we approach these situations is completely different."
    to "I try very hard to adapt, while you..."
    ya "I rely on the word of God to get me through everything."
    ya "There is no sense in adapting when we are all but fodder for the one so commonly mislabeled."
    ya "And, before long, we will find ourselves waist deep in encroaching darkness. And only those with the power of the light will be able to crawl to safety."

    ya "There is no death. Just a second plane of existence. A plane much greater than this."
    to "Sensei...I am very scared of this girl."
    s "Me too, but you’re just going to have to live with it."
    to "Are you truly sure that a relationship with {i}her{/i} is beneficial to my academic life as well as my interpersonal one?"
    to "I understand the concept of communicating with more commoners and understanding their thought processes, but Yasu seems to be anything but common."
    to "I can’t help but feel like this is only going to make things worse for me."
    s "And it might. But that’s just how life works."
    s "Sometimes, you try things out for a little while and find out they don’t really work. "
    s "Then you move onto whatever is next and try again."
    s "And then everything repeats until you die."
    ya "There is no death. Just a second plane of-"
    s "We know. Thanks, Yasu."
    ya "Praise be."

    with dissolve

    to "Well...I know I told my mother I would listen to you. And I know that you {i}allegedly{/i} have my best interests in mind-"
    to "But I would like to implore you to at least closely observe the...dynamic between Yasu and I in the event of the two of us...not getting along very well."
    s "Sure thing."

    "Not like I wasn’t already planning on closely observing two more adorable girls anyway. "

    s "In the meantime, why not find out something you two have in common?"

    scene yasutoukahall18
    with dissolve

    to "That...doesn’t sound like a bad idea. "
    to "But...will we be able to find anything?"
    ya "On cold nights, I like to wander the streets in search of the lost or the weary and translate the whispers of the dead for them."
    ya "What do you like to do with your free time, Touka?"
    to "Um...I like...horses?"
    s "Perfect. So take this weekend to go ride horses in the morning and then scare random people on their way home at night."
    s "I’m glad I was able to help you two figure this out."

    scene yasutoukahall19
    with dissolve

    ya "Thank you, Sensei!"
    to "Wait! We haven’t figured anything out at all!"
    to "I don’t know the first thing about the whispers of the dead!"
    s "And how much do you think Yasu knows about horses?"
    ya "I know that the white horse is a common symbol of “death” and that horse worship can be dated as far back as the bronze age."
    s "Okay, so maybe Yasu knows a little more about horses than you know about dead people. "
    s "But I’d still say you’re on pretty equal footing."

    with dissolve

    to "Ugh...If I had known how disadvantageous it would be to live this long without associating with “normal” people, I'd have asked Mother to send me out on my own ages ago."
    to "I can only fear what will become of Tsukasa the moment she finds out the world isn’t as she sees it now."
    ya "Nothing you see is as it seems, Touka. "
    ya "Only the chosen can truly discern the paths we walk and the trials and tribulations we will encounter along the way."
    ya "And so I ask that you put your faith in me, and I will put mine in you."
    ya "This is the start of something beautiful, after all."
    ya "A beautiful start here in this beginning of beginnings. "
    ya "The first step on the journey to salvation. A journey I will hold your freshly cleaned hands for."
    to "Thank you for not talking about the bacteria this time. I really appreciate that."
    ya "I am a good learner. A quick learner."

    s "It’s settled then. "
    s "Starting right now, you two are friends and must learn to get along with one another. "

    to "I know, I know...I apologize for my outburst earlier."
    to "It has just been a very stressful week for me."
    ya "Thank you for taking the time to remind us of how deeply you care for our well-being, Sensei."

    "I turn around and leave the two of them, not being immediately stopped this time."
    "To be quite honest, I doubt their relationship will work out at all."
    "They’re far too different and...far too eccentric to ever work in tandem with one another."
    "All I can hope is that they don’t drive each other insane."
    "Well, all I can hope is that Yasu doesn’t drive Touka insane, I guess. "
    "I’m pretty sure Yasu is a lost cause already."
    "Regardless, there’s no telling how things will play out without the passage of time."
    "And what better way to pass the time than to leave work and aimlessly wander around Kumon-mi for what is likely the millionth, billionth, or trillionth time?..."

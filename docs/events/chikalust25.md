    c "As you may have observed in the past, I am not exactly good at being quiet. But I don’t really mind if you heard either way."
    c "As the reigning Dorm War date champion {size=-15}and your adoring girlfriend,{/size} I think I deserve some time alone with you too, you know."
    s "You realize there’s a new champion now, right?"
    c "Sure, but...come on. We both know I’m the {i}real{/i} champion since I’ve swallowed at least three gallons of your cum so far."

    s "Come with you where? Don’t we have to go to the next contest thing?"
    c "That’s not for another forty-five minutes and all of the girls are in the dining hall right now. I want to explore because, let’s face it, the chance of {i}me{/i} ever living in a place like this is less than zero."
    s "We’re going to get lost."
    c "It’s fine. I have the Tsukioka Manor GPS app."
    s "Why is there a Tsukioka Manor GPS app?"

    "Thankfully, we don’t run into anyone {i}at all{/i} as it seems the entirety of the class really is in the dining hall at the moment."
    "And while that is certainly a place I would like to be as well considering investing really runs up an appetite, I {i}also{/i} want to savor this moment with Chika."

    with dissolve

    c "Castle? Monologue? Was I there for that?"
    s "In the background, yeah. Just a thought I had once."
    s "It feels like such a long time ago at this point, though."

    scene poorgirldoggystyle9
    with dissolve

    c "Yeah. We’ve sure come a long way, haven’t we?"
    c "Thinking that while standing in a place like this makes it feel like the final scene of a movie."
    s "That’s the second time you’ve brought up movies in like, thirty seconds."
    c "I know, but {i}just look at it.{/i}"
    c "When you grow up in a tiny apartment in a run-down neighborhood, you really start to forget that places like this actually exist and aren’t just made up."
    s "I think the Tsukiokas are a rare case and that this isn’t really a good indicator of life outside of your bubble. Especially when your bubble contains a lot more people than one like this ever will."
    c "That’s just the thing, though. {i}All{/i} of us in that bubble dream of having stuff like this one day, but we know that it’s a height we’ll never be able to reach."
    c "So, instead...we rely on tiny bursts of luxury like new accessories or HBO movie rentals or...bleaching our hair or...getting an extra topping on pizza. The little stuff, you know?"
    s "And seeing something like this...you don’t feel disheartened? Or think it’s a waste of money? Because this hall is probably worth more than your entire building and it’s not even being used."
    c "Jealous, sure. But disheartened? Not at all."
    c "I’m happy there are people who get to live like this...in their own little fairy tales."
    c "But I guess I shouldn’t be {i}too{/i} jealous."
    s "And why’s that?"

    scene poorgirldoggystyle10
    with dissolve

    c "Because...I’ve got my own fairy tale."
    s "..."
    c "..."
    c "{i}It’s you. You’re the fairy tale.{/i}"
    s "I got that. It was just so cute that my brain short-circuited and wouldn’t let me respond."
    c "If I had to choose between you and the house, though...I’d definitely go with the house. I’m not an idiot."
    s "Yeah, I’d go with the house too. And thanks for retroactively making your previous statement less cute. I think I’ve finally regained feeling in my legs and can walk again."
    c "Want to put ‘em to use and look around a little more? I doubt Tsubasa will care if it’s just us."
    s "If she even finds us, you mean. Which I highly doubt she will considering just how massive this place is."
    c "Then it shouldn’t be a problem at all. Right, Sensei?"
    s "..."
    c "Sensei?"
    s "I was just wondering if I could hold the leash again."
    c "Arf."
    c "That’s wolf for-"

    c "Plan? No."
    c "Hope? Yes."
    s "Welp."
    c "Remind me- how firm is that “No more sex in places we probably shouldn’t have sex” rule? Because I’ve done very well so far and I’m not saying we should {i}break{/i} that rule, but..."
    c "I think we should break that rule."
    s "We don’t even know whose bed this is."

    c "Oh yeah? Does it get you hard when I give myself up like this, [chikamaster]?"
    c "You like it when I wave my little ass in the air for you?"
    s "Don’t take this the wrong way, but that is certainly not a {i}little{/i} ass."
    c "It’s little compared to {i}you,{/i} [chikamaster]."
    c "Those big, strong hands...grabbing and slapping my skin until you can see your hand prints..."
    c "Pulling me closer...pressing it up against your waist...remembering how {i}tight{/i} it’ll be inside of me..."
    c "Then taking that {i}huge{/i} cock of yours into your hands...angling yourself down..."
    c "You’ve practically got me panting already...what are you waiting for?"
    s "The end of your story."
    c "You really want me to spoil it when you can just find out yourself?"
    s "It’s more that I just want to hear you say it."
    c "Fine. But only because I love you."
    c "The story ends with you grabbing my fluffy, little tail..."
    c "Pulling me closer again..."
    c "Guiding that big dick right up to my pussy..."
    c "And then breeding me like there is no tomorrow."

    with dissolve2

    "Not wanting to ruin her story...I grab her tail, which seems to be sewn directly onto a pair of underwear she deemed modest enough to wear as a Halloween costume, and pull her ass up a little further."
    "My grip on this new appendage also allows me to make it to the penultimate part of her story’s ending as I bend it to the right to slide her panties aside before guiding my dick to her slit..."
    "And then, just as she said I would- I throw myself into mating season and breed her like there’s no tomorrow."

    c "AaaaAAAaaahhhhhhh fuuuUUUuuuuck, [chikamaster]...thank you...thank you...thank you..."
    c "Thank you so much for...fucking the heat out of your little doggy...whatever...hah! Whatever...can I do...to repay you?..."
    s "No need...this is reward enough for me..."
    c "Hah...hah...yeah?...Are you gonna...give me...lots and lots...of cum...[chikamaster]?..."
    s "I’ll see what I can do..."
    c "Are you...gonna give me...three gallons of-"
    s "Chika."
    c "Heheh...hehehaha...ngh...just a little...joke...is all..."
    c "Just trying to...be man’s best friend...and nothing says loyalty like...keeping you entertained as you...fuck my tight...undeserving pussy..."
    s "Undeserving?"
    c "Hah...ngh...mhm! I might be your...girlfriend by day, but...I’m just your pet right now...and you’re just...fulfilling your duties as...my loving master."
    s "Ah, so we’re roleplaying."
    c "Hah...aaaaahhhh fuck! Is that...not allowed? Want me to...go back to being...normal Chika?..."
    c "Or can I stay a...horny wolf for...a little while longer?..."
    s "You really like this, don’t you?"
    c "I think...something is...awakening in me..."

    c "Aah! Ah! Ah! AAAAAhhh! [chikamaster]! Ahhh! Yes! Yes, yes, yes!"

    "I begin pounding Chika at full force to see what else I can awaken in her. But, at this point, I’d be surprised if she was able to make it an extra five minutes without having an orgasm so intense she passes out."
    "Her hips begin to shake violently and it’s hard to discern whether it’s because of the amount of force I’m placing on them or if she’s just so far gone into ecstasy that she can barely feel anything else."

    c "Aaaahhhh! AAAAAHhhh FUuuuuUUCK! Just like...that! AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!"

    "The silence in this wing of the manor makes the slapping of our skin so loud that I’m convinced anyone even halfway down the hall could hear it."
    "Chika’s screams are no different as they begin to ramp up in both passion and pleasure, but there is something {i}else{/i} I want to make her do right now."

    c "Ahhhh! Yes! Harder, [chikamaster]! Harder!"
    s "Bark for me."

    c "Arf! Arf...arf...arf! Ahhhhhhhh!!!!! Arf! Arf arf! Arf!"

    "And sure, she might look ridiculous to anyone on the outside-"
    "But to me, the man who’s loved...and desired enough to make her do this, her barks and howls are a symbol of accomplishment."
    "Her tight, hot, dripping pussy and the tail still firmly clasped in my hand...{i}they{/i} are symbols of accomplishment."
    "She is not just my pet right now...she is my pet {i}forever.{/i}"
    "Which makes me elated to continue fulfilling these duties of mine."
    "And making her scream so loud she scares off all the other animals in the area."

    c "Hah...hah...hah...hah...hah..."

    "The barking turns to panting."
    "She’s no longer human at all. Just a bitch in heat getting the tension fucked out of her."
    "There are no rational thoughts, nor fanciful dreams of a mansion or a life in which things are actually {i}good...{/i}"
    "Just primitive body to body contact."
    "And fluids dripping from both her crotch and her mouth onto the unknown sheets beneath us."

    "Over the next fifteen minutes, Chika cums three times in three different positions."
    "Her body grows uncharacteristically weak for someone who is, for lack of a better term, an expert at taking dick...so I do what any good master would do."
    "I grab her leash for a third time today and pull her body back toward me, propping her up on my lap as I insert myself once more and force her to ride me like the {i}undeserving{/i} bitch she is."

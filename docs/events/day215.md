    "Two wooden doors and the feeling that something horrible is going to happen cloud my thoughts as I sit in my chair and wait for the day to end."
    "It’s a good chair. "
    "I’ve come to find it comfortable on several occasions now."
    "The fabric is easily warmed up by my body heat and only scratches mildly against exposed skin."
    "Not like my skin is ever exposed in it to begin with."

    if bonus == True:
        "Apart from all of the times I've touched myself while waiting for the day to end, at least."
        "My skin touches the chair when that happens."
        "I remember the light scratch of the fabric as my balls brush against it better than I remember most things."
        "But then again, the dried remnants of my self-pleasure that coat the underside of my desk are just one more article on the ever growing list of things that will not cling to my mind any longer than necessary."

    play sound "knock.mp3"

    "Why doesn't anything ever cling when I want it to?"

    m "You’re not with anyone in there, are you?"

    "Two wooden doors and a normal [teenage]girl cloud my thoughts as I sit in a chair with only slightly-scratchy fabric and dwell on the negative emotions lurking somewhere behind my eyes."
    "She’s probably here to warn me about something."

    m "Good evening."
    s "Hey. I’m assuming you didn’t just come to say hello?"
    m "Of course not."
    m "I’m here to tell you the world is going to end soon."
    s "Of course you are."
    m "Are you prepared this time?"
    m "You aren’t going to take forever to find me again, are you?"
    s "Will you be in the same place as last time?"
    m "You mean the same place I always reset everything? Yes."
    s "Then, yeah. I’ll meet you on the rooftop."
    m "Good. I wish you the best of luck."
    s "Thanks..."
    s "Is that all?"
    m "…"

    scene twowoodendoors3

    m "You seem eager to get rid of me."
    m "Please don’t assume this is me going out of my way for you, but is there something troubling you by any chance?"
    m "Your mental state directly correlates to how long I’m going to have to wait on that rooftop for."
    m "So if you’re not feeling well, I may have to come get you myself."

    scene twowoodendoors4
    with dissolve

    m "And that..."
    m "…"
    m "Would bother me."
    s "I’ve actually been wondering about a lot of things lately. Ever since Halloween."

    scene twowoodendoors5
    with dissolve

    m "What have you been wondering?"
    m "I’m by no means as all-knowing as you assume I am, but if it’s something that isn’t too annoying, I might be able to answer now."
    s "Well, to start, I’ve been kind of worried about Molly and Tsuneyo."
    m "Interesting. Why?"
    s "Wasn’t their arrival strange? They weren’t there at all until after the world reset. "
    s "They just kind of showed up one day and-"

    scene twowoodendoors6
    with dissolve

    m "And you’re worried they’re going to go away just as easily."
    m "Did you really become so attached to those two in such a short time?"
    s "They’re the ones who have grown attached to me. I just don’t want them to be upset if they keep their memories of all of this and then just..."
    s "Suddenly have to tell themselves it was all a lie."

    scene twowoodendoors7
    with dissolve

    m "You actually worry about things like that?"
    s "Reluctantly. Just a side effect of having compassion, I guess."
    m "You and compassion don’t exactly mix. "
    s "Tell me about it."

    scene twowoodendoors8
    with dissolve

    "Maya closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. "
    "A while ago, I feel like getting her to be comfortable enough to even blink around me was taxing. "
    "The fact that she keeps her eyes closed for a total of seven seconds as she debates how to respond to me is proof of how far we have come since back then."
    "And perhaps proof of how far she will fall if this {i}reset{/i} isn’t as successful as the last."

    scene twowoodendoors9
    with dissolve

    m "I don’t know what will happen with those two."
    m "Their transfer into the class wasn’t a one-time thing. It’s happened before. "
    m "But it’s rare. "
    m "I suppose it’s just based on circumstance or RNG or something along those lines. "
    m "But I wouldn’t get my hopes up of them returning."
    s "I see."

    "I figured the answer would be something like that."
    "But I guess that means there’s no use beating myself up over it."
    "I’ll just let time be the cruel bitch that it is and steal away some of the gifts that I’ve obtained purely due to chance. "

    s "What about other students?"
    m "Other students?"
    s "People in situations like Tsuneyo or Molly that just...transfer into the class out of nowhere."

    else:
        m "What, is ten targets not enough for you? Why can't you just hug me instead of wasting your time on anyone else?"
        s "What?"
        m "What? I didn't say anything."

    s "I’m just curious. You said you’d answer my questions."

    scene twowoodendoors11
    with dissolve

    m "These are rooftop questions. You’re not supposed to ask them in a place like this."
    s "Would you prefer I didn’t ask them at all and-"
    m "It’s not possible."
    m "It’s either ten or twelve."
    m "Taking on any more than that would be extremely problematic for me."
    s "For you? Why would it be a problem for you?"

    scene twowoodendoors2
    with dissolve

    m "That’s another rooftop-question, I’m afraid. And even then it’s unlikely I’d answer it."
    s "Why not?"
    m "Do you really need to ask?"
    m "I don’t trust you."
    m "We’re not friends."
    m "We’re no closer than we were the first time {i}you{/i} came to the shrine."
    m "You just know slightly more about me."
    m "But, in your own words, even those things are just additions to your ever-growing list of things to forget."
    m "Aren’t they, {i}Sensei?{/i}"

    "The way the last words roll off her tongue makes her sound like some sort of serpent."
    "Venom seeps from her fangs and into my skin, thickening my blood to the point where it can no longer circulate."
    "I die as she watches and then slithers away without even consuming her prey."

    play sound "knock.mp3"

    mi "Umm...S-Sensei? You in there?"
    m "Oh. I didn’t know you were expecting someone."
    s "Neither did I."
    mi "Oh, crap. Uhh, I can hear you guys in there so I’ll just go-"
    s "It’s fine, Miku. Give me a few minutes."
    mi "Umm...okay..."
    m "Am I being kicked out?"
    s "Would you rather stay?"
    m "Good point. Not really."
    m "I’ve said all I’ve come to say."
    m "Aside from one thing, that is."
    s "And what’s that one thing, Maya?"

    scene twowoodendoors12
    with dissolve

    "She looks away and remains silent."
    "It lasts another seven seconds, just like when she closed her eyes."
    "Then her mouth opens and the venom pours out once again."

    m "The second time can be rough."
    m "You might find it harder to breathe than normal."
    m "Your legs might feel weak. Your stomach may feel as if it’s being tied into knots."
    m "But if you make it to the rooftop..."

    scene twowoodendoors13

    m "…"
    m "Never mind."

    s "Karaoke?"

    "Maya exits the room before her train of thought ever reaches its destination."
    "Or perhaps it did reach its destination, and that’s precisely why she left in the first place."
    "There’s no way to tell with her."
    "She’s a strange girl."
    "Or rather-"
    "Completely and irrefutably normal."

    play sound "knock.mp3"

    s "Go ahead, Miku. The door is open."

    play sound "dooropen.mp3"
    scene twowoodendoors14
    with dissolve

    "Another girl makes her way into my room for what appears to be the first time."
    "I can’t confirm whether she’s been here for other Senseis or not, but I know from things she’s told me that she doesn’t particularly like it in here."
    "Whatever brought her in must be serious."

    mi "Sorry to bother you...I know you were busy with Maya and stuff."
    s "It’s fine. Maya was just being Maya."
    s "Is something wrong?"
    mi "Mhm. Somethin’ is really heckin’ wrong, but not with me."

    "Not with her?..."

    s "Makoto, then?"
    s "Is this about how she was acting in class yesterday?"
    mi "Yeah. She slept through all of today so it wasn’t really a big problem but...I’d be lyin’ if I said I wasn’t a little worried."
    mi "And by “a little worried” I mean I’m really friggin’ worried. I’ve never seen her like this before and she won’t even tell me what’s goin’ on."
    mi "Weirdo even unplugged our alarm clock for no reason and now I’ve gotta use my phone to get up in the morning."
    s "And you think there’s something I can do about this?"

    scene twowoodendoors15
    with dissolve

    mi "Kinda...yeah..."
    mi "More than I can do at least..."
    mi "I’ve told ya how much she likes you and all that..."

    if bonus == True:
        mi "Ever since her dad started bangin’ aliens in space, she’s looked at you as some kinda stand-in. Just a stand-in that she has some pretty raunchy thoughts about at times, apparently."
        s "I take it this means the best friend blowjob duo isn’t happening?"
    else:
        mi "Ever since her dad started huggin' all those aliens, she’s looked at you as some kinda stand-in."
        s "I take it this means the group hug isn’t happening?"

    scene twowoodendoors16
    with dissolve

    mi "Be serious, Sensei! This is a big deal!"
    mi "Makoto’s always the one lookin’ out for me when I’m gettin’ all weird so bein’ on the opposite end of the stick is makin’ me really scared!"

    scene twowoodendoors17
    with dissolve

    mi "Like, if it’s this hard for me to do anything about her, I can only imagine what it must be like havin’ to hold me down against the bed so I don’t tear all of my hair out."
    mi "Just...pull her aside and give her a big hug or somethin’."
    mi "Maybe read her a new article about climate change. Idunno. Stuff Makoto would be into."
    s "I can try but...that girl’s really only opened up to me twice. And the second time she got all weird out of nowhere and-"

    "Wait a second..."
    "That’s exactly when she started acting strange, isn’t it?"
    "It wasn’t until after our conversation on the roof that Maki started spotting differences in her behavior."
    "And then there was the incident in class."
    "But all she did was ask me to close my eyes and then...started crying and got all quiet."
    "What happened?"

    scene twowoodendoors18
    with dissolve

    mi "Sensei? What’s up? You remember somethin’?"
    s "Kind of. "
    s "The two of us had a talk on the rooftop recently about where Makoto thinks her future is going and how she misses her dad."
    s "I guess...all of that is just getting to her?"

    scene twowoodendoors19
    with dissolve

    mi "No...I don’t think somethin’ that small would get to Makoto. She’s used to carryin’ all kinds of burdens."

    if bonus == True:
        mi "It’s gotta be somethin’ else. Or maybe puberty is just makin’ it worse or somethin’. I don’t friggin’ know."
        mi "Just thinkin’ about it this much makes my head hurt."

    scene twowoodendoors20
    with dissolve

    mi "Could you at least try talkin’ to her if ya get a second? You don’t need to say I came here or anything."
    mi "Just have it be a {i}you{/i} thing."
    mi "I’m super duper worried and I just want her to go back to normal so I can go back to bein’ all hyper and stuff."
    mi "I’m a really bad babysitter. I don’t know how people do it."
    s "Sure. I’ll talk to her soon."
    s "Thanks for coming all the way over here just to tell me that."

    scene twowoodendoors21
    with dissolve

    mi "You don’t gotta thank me...I’m just doin’ what any best friend would do..."
    mi "And I kinda trust you when it comes to all this adult stuff so...there’s not anyone else I can think of who’d be able to help right now."

    scene twowoodendoors22
    with dissolve

    mi "But, uhh...I’m not tryin’ to get all sappy outta nowhere so I’ll just...be on my way, I guess!"
    mi "Thanks for hearin’ me out, Sensei! Forget I ever came here and...remember to look both ways when crossin’ the street and stuff!"

    scene twowoodendoors1
    with dissolve
    play sound "dooropen.mp3"

    mi "Sayonara! Let me know if you hear anythin’!"
    mi "Or don’t! I don’t know!"
    mi "Uhhhhh goodbye!"

    "Miku sprints out of the room at a pace I don’t even usually see her break out during soccer practice."
    "It’s good knowing that she cares {i}that much{/i} about her friend, but..."
    "I hope she hasn’t placed too much faith in me."
    "I’m not great when it comes to solving other peoples’ problems."
    "Is that something someone in my position, atop a chair with slightly-scratchy fabric and behind two wooden doors, should be saying?"
    "Of course not."
    "But I say it regardless."

    scene black
    with dissolve

    "And then I close my eyes for a total of seven seconds."
    "Just as many as Maya closed hers for while dodging my rooftop questions in a non-rooftop setting."
    "And I think of what I can do for Makoto."

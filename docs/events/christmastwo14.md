    w "It’s been quite a while since we’ve done anything like this, hasn’t it?"
    os "Probably about...365 days?"
    os "They normally take Christmas trees down after Christmas is over."
    w "Then we should probably stop waiting until February to remove ours."
    os "We’ll get to it when we get to it."
    w "That we will, my kitten."
    os "Hey...Wakana?"
    w "Yes, my love?"
    os "Thanks for coming tonight...I know you don’t normally like doing things like this."
    w "The list of things I actively enjoy is rather short...so if I am able to make your life the slightest bit better by staring at lights with you, I will happily blind myself."
    os "I mean...you don’t have to go that far."
    w "But I would."
    w "There are few things in life I would not do for you, Osako."
    os "You’re...being surprisingly sentimental all of a sudden. It’s not like you."
    w "Indeed I am."
    w "Perhaps this is what they call “Christmas spirit?”"
    w "It’s quite strange how simply staring at this tree compels me to say things like this to you."
    w "But I suppose I’m a rather compulsive woman by nature, aren’t I?"
    os "That’s a little bit of an understatement..."
    os "It’s not like that’s a new characteristic or anything, though. I’ve known you to be that person ever since I met you and it did nothing to keep me away."
    os "In fact, I kind of like that side of you sometimes. It keeps things...I don’t know, exciting?"
    w "And other times?"
    os "..."
    w "You can be honest with me. "
    w "Hold nothing back for my sake."
    os "Then..."
    os "Other times, it’s terrifying."
    os "Like, right now, everything is great. But sometimes, it feels like you’re not even living in the same world as me."
    os "And you’ll do these things that I know you wouldn’t {i}choose{/i} to do if the choice was fully yours. Like...with what happened on the beach."
    w "I apologize again for that."
    os "You’ve apologized probably a hundred times by now....and I’ve accepted every single one of them."
    os "But that doesn’t stop me from worrying about something like that happening again in the future."
    os "That’s the compulsive behavior I’m really worried about. I don’t mind the small stuff like...spending too much money on clothes or...inviting your coworker over to make weird, jello soup."
    w "Perhaps you could chain me up to prevent those compulsions from showing up ever again? It might be fun experiencing how you feel all the time."
    os "Not right now, please."
    w "I’m sorry for the 101st time. But before you can accept this one as well, please let me say something."
    os "You can say whatever you want. We have the entire night to ourselves."
    w "And I’d like to have many more."
    w "That’s all I wanted to say, really. Just in a lot more words than that."
    w "Despite how displeased I am with the lights and sounds and crowds of people, I would not trade a moment like this for the world. And that is because you are here with me."
    w "I want there to be to many more Christmases after this one."
    w "I want to hate these lights and sounds and crowds of people so much more."
    w "And even if I make mistakes, the same way any other human does, I do not want them to sabotage this perpetual cycle of recycled holidays and excuses to walk beside you."
    os "Your last mistake almost {i}killed{/i} you, Wakana."
    os "And I know that’s not what you were trying to do, but it’s what happened."
    os "What if I didn’t come back when I did? "
    os "What if I walked around for even, like...half an hour longer? Who knows if we’d even be standing here right now?"
    w "That thought is precisely {i}why{/i} I did what I did, Osako."
    w "In my eyes, as clouded as they were at the time, I felt as if I was going to die if I {i}didn’t{/i} do something."
    w "Obviously, that was not the correct decision in hindsight, but people can not be expected to think rationally when faced with fear."
    os "Do you at least understand why I’ve been so...neurotic lately, then? "
    w "I believe the word you are searching for is “clingy,” my kitten. And yes, I do."
    os "I’m sorry for that, by the way. I just keep thinking that if I don’t make sure you’re okay every few minutes that you’ll...yeah."
    w "It seems I have some work to do if you are to ever trust me again."
    os "It’s not a trust thing, it’s...ugh. I don’t know what it is."
    os "I really wish I was as good with words as you are sometimes. "
    w "And I sometimes wish that I knew how to end a human’s life by tapping the correct pressure point. "
    w "Besides, I do not mind your clinginess at all. I find it rather endearing, actually."
    w "Why else would I have not complained about it even once since college?"
    os "I don’t know, it’s..."
    os "I just...wish I could protect you a little better."
    os "I just don’t really know how to do that when I’m supposed to be protecting you from {i}yourself.{/i}"
    w "You are not {i}supposed{/i} to be doing anything, my love. "
    w "This is a battle I must fight on my own. All you need to do is be there."
    os "What if I’m not, though? Like...what if I’m at work? This is already getting to me. I’ve barely been able to focus at all lately."
    w "I know."
    w "It must be hard."
    w "But it’s my fault you’re feeling this way. So it’s also my duty to make sure it does not continue to happen."
    w "Additionally, I was not implying that you need to physically “be there.” It was more of a “Have faith in me and I will persist,” sort of thing."
    os "That somehow sounds even harder."
    w "It’s a challenge we will face together, then."
    w "Just as staring at this ridiculous fucking tree has been a challenge for me."
    os "You really hate it that much?"
    w "Why must it be so bright? And how did this strange, cultural tradition of covering a tree in lights even come to be? What significance do the lights even have? How does this relate to religion?"
    os "I think Christmas has kind of graduated being past a religious holiday for most of the cultures who actually celebrate it."
    w "Nonsense. Our tree is much better. And lasts two months longer as well."
    os "You only like our tree more because I let you cover it in lace."
    w "The only thing you will {i}not{/i} let me cover in lace is you."
    os "You know I’m not feminine enough to pull off the stuff you wear, Wakana. I’d just...feel like shit if I were to try."
    w "Oh well. It will do us no good simply standing around and discussing the things I would like to make you wear should you decide to catch up on confidence one day."
    w "There are many more trees to see- and many more chances for me to remind you how happy I am to be both alive and by your side tonight."
    os "Just try not to get lost, okay? I’m worrying enough as-is. I don’t want to have to deal with trying to find you in a crowd as well."
    w "Yes, because I do not stand out enough with my appearance. I can see how easy it would be for you to lose sight of me."
    os "You know what I mean..."

    os "Fine by me. Not like I’m going to complain about the prettiest girl here holding onto my arm."
    w "Don’t worry. I’m sure to make up for our quota of “things to complain about” for the rest of the night."
    w "Like that strange costume that man is wearing. What is that?"

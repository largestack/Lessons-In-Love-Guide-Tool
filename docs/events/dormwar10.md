    "I wake up to nothing at all."
    "A horrible start to the day."
    "I faintly recall getting up in the middle of the night to blast the AC, but it has now reached a point where I am so cold that I don’t even want to move."
    "So I lie here and die."
    "I lie here underneath a beige ceiling, accompanied by the four paperthin walls propping it up-"
    "And die."
    "Goodbye, world."

    s "…"

    "I stare up and try to connect this morning’s vision with the one I’m most accompanied with."
    "This ceiling is lower than the one in my room, which means that if I were to continue growing, I’d hit my head on this one before the other."
    "But that’s just how verticality works."
    "The higher something is, the safer it is."
    "So we should all ascend and ascend and ascend, placing ourselves on top of the highest things we can find."
    "Because only then can we look down at those who have had their growth stunted and laugh a hearty laugh, pressing our hands against the skin of our arms to scare away the goosebumps."

    s "…"

    "I have never liked the way the world looks right after opening my eyes."
    "It’s one of the saddest views of all."
    "Because even though it is wonderful to breathe and wonderful to see-"
    "It is not wonderful to be."
    "But I am."

    q "Oh, you’re up."

    i "Yo."
    s "...Io?"
    i "Io. "
    s "What are you doing here?"
    i "Avoiding female contact."
    s "Yes, but...when did you even get here? I went to sleep pretty late."
    i "Sometime between like, 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM I think?"
    s "Uh-huh. And how exactly did you get into my room?"
    i "I told the people at the front desk that you were my dad and they just gave me a key."
    i "Crafty, right?"
    i "I’m glad you didn’t have the chain lock attached because that would have meant I’d need to go home and get my tools, which would be significantly harder to explain to the employees."
    s "You were that desperate to get away from your floormates, huh?"

    scene goodmorningio3
    with dissolve

    i "Don’t tell me you’re surprised by that."
    s "I’m not. But I {i}am{/i} surprised that you didn’t just go back to the dorm instead."
    i "To tell you the truth, so am I."
    i "But it was somewhere around like 1:30 that I started thinking about stuff, and among all of those thoughts was this one guy who looks kind of like you."
    s "Kind of?"
    i "Kind of. You look pretty different without your glasses."
    s "And you look different in...whatever you’re wearing right now."

    scene goodmorningio4
    with dissolve

    i "What’s wrong with what I’m wearing right now?"
    s "It's..."
    s "Nothing. It's fine."
    i "If you close your eyes, I can put my normal clothes back on. I got changed while you were sleeping and just threw them all at the foot of your bed."
    s "At least have the courtesy to wake me up next time."

    scene goodmorningio5
    with dissolve

    i "You did wake up. You stepped on my leg on your way to the air conditioner before deciding that you wanted to freeze the two of us to death."
    s "I’m sure I was only subconsciously trying to freeze myself to death. I didn’t realize you were here."
    i "And literally stepping on me wasn’t enough to give that away?"
    s "I...was apparently very tired."

    scene goodmorningio6
    with dissolve

    i "Well, since you’re awake now, how about we start drafting our escape plan?"
    s "Escape plan?"
    i "Yeah. Where we ditch the rest of this competition thing and go hang out at an amusement park or something."
    s "I don’t think I’m allowed to do that, unfortunately."
    i "What do you mean you’re not allowed? You’re a grown man and you make your own rules."
    i "What do you have to gain by letting a bunch of annoying [teens] drag you around like you’re some kind of dog all day?"
    s "What do I have to gain by ditching them to be with you?"

    scene goodmorningio7
    with dissolve

    i "One whole Io. Redeemable wherever Ios are accepted."
    i "So basically nowhere because Io is trash and her value keeps getting lower and lower with each passing day."
    s "Yeah, that doesn’t sound like a great investment."

    scene goodmorningio6
    with dissolve

    i "What if I add like...a snack to the deal? You like potato chips?"
    i "Let’s go get potato chips. And soda. And then ride some big fucking rollercoaster or something."
    s "You have too much energy for it being this early..."
    s "In fact, why are you even awake? Didn’t you say you didn’t fall asleep until like 2:00 or 3:00?"
    i "Ish. But it’s not really easy to sleep when A: you stepped on me and really hurt my leg. And B: I had to sleep on the floor."
    i "Like, yeah, I’ve got a futon and stuff..."
    i "But that bed looks crazy comfortable and it gave me one of those inner struggle things where I had to think about whether or not it would be cool to join you in there."
    s "I wouldn’t have minded. Though, it definitely would have been a little more confusing to wake up to that when I feel like I haven’t seen much of you at all lately."

    scene goodmorningio8
    with dissolve

    i "And whose fault is that?"
    i "You realize that you’re one of the two people I actually enjoy spending time with, right?"
    i "And Uta’s been kind of all over me lately, so it would be nice if you’d come see me more to balance out the scale and blah blah blah Io is needy."
    s "Speaking of Uta, did you ever tell her where you ran off to? I know she was looking for you last night."
    s "In fact, where {i}did{/i} you run off to?"
    i "I think some of Ayane’s blood splashed onto me after she was decimated at the maid cafe, so I wound up going back to my aunt’s to take a bath."
    i "Also figured that Yuki might be there since it was a Saturday night and she’s normally free around then. But nope, no dice."
    s "Probably because she was with me."

    scene goodmorningio9
    with dissolve

    i "Yuki was? "
    s "Yeah, I ran into her while I was walking around."
    i "Oh, okay. So you two didn’t like, make plans or anything. You just bumped into each other."
    i "How do you find the time to cultivate relationships with so many people, Sensei?"
    s "Easy. Time is unlimited."
    i "That’s debatable. "
    i "Time is a human construct with no direct intrinsic value, so it’s only as unlimited as we humans want or imagine it to be."
    i "Also, the fact that time itself could be considered unlimited has no bearing on the time that you, a middle aged male, have left to live your life."
    i "Cherish every second. Celebrate what it means to live. Vote Io."
    s "...Vote Io for what?"
    i "Dunno. Just sounded like a good campaign slogan."

    scene goodmorningio6
    with dissolve

    i "Anyway, is it cool if I use your shower to get ready for the amusement park? I don’t really wear makeup so I’ll only be like ten minutes tops."
    s "Io, I’m not going to the amusement park with you. I have to get up and...let girls fight over me or something."
    i "But I’m fighting for you right now. Why does anyone else need to be involved?"
    s "Because they made plans to fight for me and didn’t just sneak into my room in the middle of the night."

    scene goodmorningio10
    with dissolve

    i "Guh. Who would have thought that being assertive would spell my downfall when it only seems to make you like everyone else more?"
    s "It’s not a downfall and I don’t like you any less than I did before. I just can’t do what you want me to do right now."
    s "But you know what you {i}can{/i} do?"

    scene goodmorningio5
    with dissolve

    i "Please please please please please please {i}please{/i} do not ask me to join in on any of the weird “festivities” our class has planned for today."
    i "It sucks enough that I’m already showing up for like half of them."
    i "Expecting me to join in and talk to people on top of that is just like...yeah, no."
    i "Like, I said maybe two sentences to that Chika girl during the sports thing yesterday and even that was more associating than I planned on doing the whole weekend."
    s "Why not Yumi, then?"

    scene goodmorningio11
    with dissolve

    i "Oh, right. You weren’t there for it when we were choosing the competitions, but I’m pretty sure Yumi wants to fight me."
    s "What? Why?"
    i "Probably because I’m like half her size and she has anger issues that likely stem from repeated emotional abuse at a [young]age."
    s "…"
    s "Why do you have to be so real all the time?"

    scene goodmorningio7
    with dissolve

    i "Real? I’m more fake than like, all of the people I call out for {i}being{/i} fake on a daily basis."
    i "It’s a very complicated situation, but I’d be more than happy to explain it to you on a rollercoaster."
    s "Io..."

    scene goodmorningio12
    with dissolve

    i "Hah...Yeah, yeah. I know."
    i "There won’t {i}be{/i} a rollercoaster because I was too spontaneous for you and didn’t fill out the proper “Sensei request” forms."

    with dissolve

    i "Sure. Why not? Invite her on in and I’ll tell her all about why I prefer being with you over like 99.99%% of the world."

    i "What must be-"
    i "Hey! Sensei! I would have...gone in on my own!"

        "Chika digs two of her fingers into the waistband of my sweatpants and attempts to tug me close to her."
        "I refuse to move forward for obvious reasons, but this just makes her more aggressive as she inserts her entire hand into my pants."

        c "Do guys always get hard while they sleep or did I just get lucky today?"

        c "Mnh~ No...it’s probably not."

    "And I stand there with her."
    "Not saying anything, and barely thinking anything other than “Fuck. This sucks.” which, in my defense, it does."

    "Or, in some cases-"

    i "Is that really the kind of girl you’re into? Is it because she, like...put out right away or something?"
    s "It’s not that. I just-"
    i "Is it just blondes in general? Is that your thing? Because there was that other girl who you already-"
    s "Io, correct me if I’m wrong, but haven’t you said before that who I “see” is none of your business?"

    scene goodmorningio22
    with dissolve

    i "It’s {i}not{/i} any of my business! You can do whatever you want and I don’t have the right to get upset over it!"
    i "But..."
    i "But I’m apparently going to get upset over it anyway!"
    s "Why?"
    i "Because I’m sensitive! And a hypocrite! You know these things!"
    s "I do. Which is why I’m not holding this against you and lecturing you the way I did when you talked down on Ayane without getting to know her."

    i "But of course I decided to be {i}me{/i} again and just started venting without even thinking about how it would make you feel."
    i "I’m sure you have your reasons for whatever you’re doing with that girl."
    s "And I’m sure you have your reasons for the way you’re reacting to it."
    i "And I’m sure that I’ll wind up telling you all about them at the worst or most inappropriate time one of these days."

    s "It was bound to happen sooner or later. But it’s really not as serious as she made it sound and-"
    i "I’m sorry if this is blunt, but I really don’t care."

    "The two girls remain silent as Futaba keeps up a steady pace and forces me over the edge."
    "I “subconsciously” try to lean toward Nodoka to grant her wish about getting some on her, but Futaba grips me tightly enough to prevent that from happening."
    "Of course, in doing so, she takes everything directly on her face, which I’m sure makes Nodoka just as happy."

    no "Oh, absolutely. But Futaba’s bravery and willingness to finally stand up to my incessant sexual prodding has earned her at least {i}one{/i} point as far as I’m concerned."
    f "Um...are there any...tissues or?..."
    s "I wouldn’t mind giving you a turn of your own if you’re willing to wait a few-"
    no "No time. Sorry, Sensei. "
    no "Things to do, people to see. Futabas to wipe teacher-semen off of."

    no "You heard the girl. "

    no "Okay...come on, Futaba. Let’s get you cleaned up."

    "Nodoka stands up and pulls Futaba to her feet as well, escorting her into the bathroom and helping her regain her vision."
    "The two of them come back moments later and decide to hang around for another hour or so before leaving."
    "And, just like the actual “contest,” the entire thing is extremely casual."
    "There are jokes to be made about Futaba’s sudden switch from innocent to not, but none of them are malicious and...well, she seems to handle it all surprisingly well."
    "It’s nothing like the Futaba I first ran into at the library, which seems so long ago now."
    "And I’m sure that some of it has to do with the fact that it was Nodoka beside her and not anyone else-"
    "But I know that some of it is simply because she has grown."
    "And will continue to grow."
    "Just like a tree."

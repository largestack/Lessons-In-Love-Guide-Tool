    no "Oh, how the mighty Yumi Yamaguchi has fallen...Reduced to a desperate mess of tears and hormones as she gently rubs herself for a small group of lascivious spectators."
    no "I imagine you didn’t expect your first sexual experience with her to be like {i}this,{/i} did you? "
    no "Assuming this is your first. But based on how much our unpaid talent is nervously quivering, I’m pretty sure it is."
    no "I was hoping she’d face us, though. From this angle, it’s hard to tell if there’s been any insertion yet."
    no "Perhaps she’s saving that part for you, Sensei? Perhaps she {i}wants{/i} you to make your way over there and help her get the job done?"
    no "I know {i}I{/i} would love to see that. "
    no "I’d just ask that you rough her up a bit. We don’t want her enjoying herself too much, do we?"

    no "This is nothing compared to a lifetime worth of doubting yourself and thinking you’re not worthy of even stepping into the same room as your peers."
    no "This is nothing compared to the strain your words have caused on the mind of my friend. Nothing compared to the acid burns and scar tissue now coating her esophagus."
    no "Do you know what it’s like to be scarred on the inside, Yumi? To have all of your ailments hidden so deep inside of yourself that no one even knows they’re there? "
    no "So you have to masturbate in front of a couple people. Boo fucking hoo. "
    no "If you weren’t such a tsundere, you’d already be doing this for one of us on a nearly weekly basis anyway. "
    no "If anything, you should be {i}thankful{/i} that my perversion has created such a lenient and {i}simple{/i} way for you to repent for all the damage you have caused."

    no "See, that’s where I disagree."
    no "Set aside your feelings and objectively approach this situation as if it’s a scene in a book."
    no "What half-assed, incompetent writer would set up such a dramatic and heart wrenching scenario only to backtrack on it once things become too painful?"
    no "Things that hurt are what provide the incentive for us to push through as readers and progress the story. Things that hurt are why we gorge ourselves on words in the first place."
    no "I suppose you could argue that the opposite side of things can be just as fulfilling, and that pain alone is not what brings us satisfaction."
    no "But to that I’d say- remember what you’re reading."
    no "We’re not worthy of happy endings."
    no "We’re the ones who opened up this book knowing what was inside of it. "
    no "And the idea of us changing our minds just because the immersion is becoming too much to bear would make us so weak that it would be utterly sickening."
    no "Are you weak, Sensei? Are you afraid of how real things can become at the drop of a hat?"
    no "Or is this a story you want to stick out until the end?"
    no "Before you answer, though, you should be reminded that closing a book doesn’t mean the story stops."
    no "It will keep going with or without you."
    no "The key is whether or not you’ll let it carry you to somewhere amazing...or drown you in a sea of letters."
    no "I’d say the choice is yours, but that choice has already been made."
    no "It was made a long time ago."

    no "Welp, time to get this show on the road. Nodoka Nagasawa is about to make her blowjob debut."
    y "Huh? No..."
    s "Are you serious?"
    no "Of course I’m serious. I gave Yumi two options. She chose the first but couldn’t complete it. Which means that we’re now defaulting to the second."

    "She tries to make eye contact with me, but I can’t bring myself to look back at her."
    "I just look away as a set of overly confident hands crawl into the opening in my pants and unsheathe my cock."
    "And, as if that wasn’t shameful enough-"
    "Witnessing all I have in this locker room has brought me within seconds of climaxing before my skin is even touched."

    "Her hair brushes against my skin each time she moves to the base of my cock and winds up getting stuck to it on several occasions."
    "She deftly moves it away with her fingers before curling them back around me and devoting every bit of her attention to pleasing me."
    "It’s not {i}just{/i} me who’s feeling the heat, though, as Nodoka’s noises grow increasingly louder the more time she spends on my cock."

    "Her sobbing at this point has grown loud enough to compete with Nodoka’s cock-sucking noises, alerting me to exactly how she feels right now."

    "Which, I won’t lie, is a lot more than I expected for her first time."
    "Her tongue presses against my dick not out of tactic or strategy, but out of desperation as it tries to find a new home in its host’s mouth."
    "But despite being practically suffocated at this point, Nodoka makes no effort to get away- letting me do what I please with her head as I grab the back of it and pull it forward like an oversized fleshlight."

    "It isn’t until that moment that I realize I never bothered putting my dick away."
    "And that I’d been hanging it in front of Yumi’s face like a carrot on a stick ever since cumming on another girl’s face right in front of her."

    "When I turn around to watch her leave, I step on the shards of a broken cellphone and almost slip because of it."
    "I kind of wish I did."
    "For even though I did not intend to hurt anyone tonight, my inaction spoke volumes in reminding her of who I really am at the end of the day."
    "I’m not someone who cares."
    "I’m not someone who’s here to help her succeed."

    no "Since when do you care?"
    no "You got what you wanted. I got what I wanted. Isn’t that really all that matters?"
    no "You know better than anyone that sometimes people need to be hurt in order for others to benefit. Today, {i}we{/i} are those beneficiaries."
    no "So what if {i}Yumi{/i} suffers after all the suffering she’s put other people through? This is sure to do more for her future cooperation than any detention or stern lecturing would."
    s "She was already {i}changing,{/i} though. She’s come a long way since I’ve met her. And she’s already apologized to Futaba and-"
    no "That’s not good enough."
    s "What?"
    no "I said that’s not good enough."
    no "This likely won’t come as a surprise, but there aren’t many people I care about in this world."
    no "And while one of the main reasons for that is that there just aren’t many people who {i}interest{/i} me, a {i}second{/i} main reason is that it’s just far too exhausting."
    no "You see, I {i}protect{/i} the people I care about. And sometimes, protecting someone means cutting down the person they must be protected {i}from.{/i}"
    no "And other times, if that person doesn’t {i}need{/i} protection anymore, I simply...avenge them instead."
    s "I don’t think Futaba wanted revenge."
    no "She didn’t."
    no "But I did."
    no "And so I got it...because I am a freethinking, powerful girl who takes what she wants {i}when{/i} she wants it."
    no "If doing that means hurting someone that matters less to me than the dirt I walk on, I really don’t care."
    no "All I have to lose is the favor of others. "
    no "That said, do {i}you{/i} think any less of me now?"
    s "Would you care if I did?"
    no "Of course. If I didn’t like you, I wouldn’t have let you cum on my face. "
    s "I..."
    s "I don’t really know how I feel."
    no "I think the fact that you {i}don’t{/i} know just confirms that your opinion of me hasn’t changed at all."
    no "If you can watch me engage in something as morally reprehensible as blackmailing someone into masturbating and then fellating the person they like in front of them...and {i}not{/i} be mad about it-"
    no "Well, let’s just say most traditionally “good” people would put their foot down then and there."
    no "But you let it happen. Albeit with a few “No, stop”s sprinkled in. But I think that was just you doing your best impression of someone with a moral compass."
    no "The truth is that you only feel bad about certain things because you think that you’re {i}supposed{/i} to feel bad."
    no "Why not just live your life surrounded by the people you care about? Why not build a moat to keep everyone else out?"

    no "Hopefully, your relationship with Yumi isn’t {i}too{/i} badly damaged based on what just happened. It would be a crying shame if you had to live the rest of your life without seeing her tits again."
    no "Fortunately, I believe all of her anger is directed at me right now. And that you should be okay for the immediate future."
    s "What about you, then? Aren’t you worried about what she’ll do to get back at you?"
    no "Right now? Not really."
    no "Right now, all of my serious thoughts are blocked by the intoxicating scent of your cum. "

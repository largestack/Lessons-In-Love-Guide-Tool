    "Today is the day that Nodoka transfers into the class, but I’m assuming you could have figured that out based on how she is standing right in front of everyone right now."

    "But, now that I think about it, I guess every single introduction we’ve had in this class has been slightly out of the ordinary."
    "I think the current record holder would actually be Uta, who flavor beamed Makoto and proceeded to arm wrestle Yumi."
    "So yeah, it would be pretty hard to have a bad introduction by comparison."

    no "Good evening, everyone."

    no "For I see it as the first step toward the rest of eternity."
    no "I’m sure there are plenty memories to be made here...plenty of fun experiences for all of us to have together."
    no "Living through all of that with you is why I exist now. "
    no "And while I may not feel the specific power Soseki mentioned in this very moment, I’m sure that I will look back on it only to be swallowed whole."
    no "Swallowed by the nostalgic waves of[school] life as if it were every first sip of sake in the entire world, formed into a single tidal wave approaching our bodies quicker than we’re approaching graduation."
    no "As if it were a cloud of incense smoke laced with the same scents that bring us comfort when we lay our heads to our pillows at night."

    "I walk over to Wakana in the middle of Nodoka’s speech to see if she needs a hug or something."

    s "Sorry, but Nodoka was insistent on you watching her introduction."
    w "I don’t understand why. She’s supposed to be your problem now."
    w "If I knew I’d be spending even {i}more{/i} time in this room, I would have just continued to deal with her on my own."
    s "But the last introduction you were here for was so memorable."
    w "Yes. It was simply delightful watching a girl with brightly colored hair talk about falling in love with you before she was even able to walk."
    s "People learn how to walk before they’re six years old, Wakana."
    w "Why? Do they not realize how exhausting walking is?"
    w "They should spend every waking moment simply sitting around until people start asking them for things. "

    s "Hah..."

    "I lean back in my chair and try to figure out what is happening to my life."
    "And when I say “my” life I mean “Sensei’s” life because, as I was reminded via brute force yesterday, it is very much not my own."
    "It’s one thing to have some girl randomly show up and talk about how she’s apparently known me for her entire life-"
    "But it’s another thing to proclaim her love for me in front of a room full of girls sliding down a slippery slope toward that same end point."
    "The biggest surprise wasn’t that at all, though."
    "It was how Maya (Of all people) reacted to the whole thing."
    "She didn’t even show up to[school] today."
    "And sure, it’s not the first time that’s happened..."
    "But to just chalk an absence up to coincidence after that outburst would be dismissing something anyone with half a brain would know is peculiar."
    "According to Ami, she didn’t even get back to the dorm until late last night."
    "But is Noriko knowing me from the past really cause for such an uncharacteristic explosion?"

    play sound "knock.mp3"

    n "Sensei~ This is your office, right?"
    n "It’s me! Noriko!"
    n "The girl with the pink hair who asked you to wait outside the classroom only to have you march all the way down here without saying anything."
    s "You can come in, Noriko."

    play sound "dooropen.mp3"
    scene norikomayaoffice2
    with dissolve

    n "Why, thank you for inviting me."
    s "No problem. Sorry I didn’t wait for you. My mind’s been a little preoccupied over the last 24 hours."
    n "I bet. Probably weird having me show up again out of nowhere and then saying all that stuff about being in love with you."
    s "A little bit, yeah."

    scene norikomayaoffice3
    with dissolve

    n "Well, it was weird for me too! I don’t think I’ve ever cried in front of so many people before."
    n "In fact, I can’t even remember the last time I cried in general. "
    n "I’ve been saving all of my tears for the moment we reunited and they just kinda came streaming out all at once. "
    n "I’m kind of excited to never have to cry again, though."
    s "You are most definitely going to cry again at some point."

    scene norikomayaoffice4
    with dissolve

    n "Nope. No time for crying. Gotta make you remember me any way I possibly can."
    n "Even if it means dressing up in clothes that are way too small for me and reenacting all of the time we used to spend together."
    s "I think the clothes you’re wearing now are perfectly fine."
    n "Okaaaay~ But if you ever change your mind, just let me know."
    n "Pretty sure I could act it out quite nicely since every second I’ve ever spent with you has been playing on repeat in my head since the moment we separated. "
    n "It’s how I’ve kept myself sane all these years."
    n "Well, mostly sane."
    n "Pretty sane."
    n "I don’t know. Lots of people at my old[school] called me crazy because I would bring a pocket knife to[school], but it’s not like I ever {i}stabbed{/i} someone, you know?"
    s "Do you...have a pocket knife with you now?"

    scene norikomayaoffice5
    with dissolve

    n "Just this little one for self defense. You never know when someone is going to pull you into an alleyway and tear your skirt off, you know?"

    scene norikomayaoffice6

    n "You can pull me into any alleyway you want, though."
    n "In fact, I encourage it."
    s "Are you even allowed to carry that with you?"
    n "I don’t know. Does it make you uncomfortable?"
    s "Yes. Please put it away."

    scene norikomayaoffice4
    with dissolve

    n "Done."
    n "There you go. Proof I’m not crazy."
    s "I’m...probably going to need a little more proof than that."
    s "No offense, but everything you’ve done since coming here has been a little bit over the top."

    scene norikomayaoffice7
    with dissolve

    n "Hey, wait a second! "
    n "{i}I’m{/i} not the one who freaked out and called someone a cunt in the middle of class."
    n "If there’s anyone who’s crazy, it’s Maya. Not me."
    n "I wouldn’t be surprised if she carried some sort of weapon with her too."
    s "Just...keep the knife in your pocket and everything will be fine."

    scene norikomayaoffice8
    with dissolve

    n "Oh, I don’t have any pockets. And I don’t carry a purse either. So I kind of keep it tucked into the side of my underwear. "
    n "This one time, it slipped out and totally sliced my leg wide open and all of the blood made people think I was on my period."
    n "I’m fine now, though. And I heal quickly so there's not even a scar anymore."
    n "Awesome, right?"
    s "…"

    scene norikomayaoffice9
    with dissolve

    n "Oh my god I missed you so fucking much."
    n "I still can’t believe I’m seeing you again."
    n "It’s like...a dream come true."
    s "I can tell..."
    s "I just wish I knew a little more about...well, what our relationship was."

    scene norikomayaoffice10
    with dissolve

    n "I’m actually your girlfriend."
    n "We have a house in Okinomiya and should get moving right away since I forgot to feed our cat this morning."

    scene norikomayaoffice15

    "Thing?"
    "... "
    "She’s talking about the accident, right?"

    s "So, you haven’t seen me since that accident?"

    scene norikomayaoffice16
    with dissolve

    n "Hm?"
    n "No, I saw you plenty of times after that. That was just the {i}first{/i} time you disappeared."
    n "I’m not sure how far back your memory goes, but you used to be a tutor."
    n "And my parents knew how much I liked you, so the second they heard about it from Nee-chan they called you and...voila."
    n "Unrequited love began to blossom."

    scene norikomayaoffice17
    with dissolve

    n "To be honest, I kind of hate myself for never even considering that you might have gone off and become a real teacher."
    n "If I had known that, finding you would have been a million times easier."
    n "Like, I know it’s only been a few years since then, but..."
    n "I can’t help like feel it's been way...{i}way{/i} longer."
    n "Almost like I’ve been searching for you for an eternity."

    scene norikomayaoffice18
    with dissolve

    n "But I guess that’s just how everything feels when you love someone who doesn’t love you back, huh?"

    "Noriko remains quiet and stares at me for several seconds. Or maybe it’s minutes."
    "I don’t know."
    "It’s kind of shocking how much this girl knows about “me.” "
    "I don’t even think I’ve heard this much detail from Ami, and now I’m getting all of it just hoisted onto me out of nowhere."

    n "Sensei...Even with how long it’s been, my feelings never changed. "
    n "You stole my heart all those years ago and now I have to steal yours. It’s only fair."
    s "Good luck. I don’t think there’s very much left of it."

    scene norikomayaoffice19
    with dissolve

    n "Ha! Now you’re starting to sound the same way you did back when you tutored me."
    n "But, I guess that’s also kind of depressing given the circumstances of why you began to speak like that in the first place, so forget I laughed."

    s "I thought that was pretty much confirmed?"
    m "Let’s say for argument’s sake that you are {i}not{/i} the “old” Sensei- and your past was reintroduced to you by someone who just so happens to {i}claim{/i} to know some aspects of it."
    m "In what way would that person’s words influence the decisions you make in your new, unrelated life? "
    s "They wouldn’t, really."
    m "Then what can you possibly gain from hearing them? "

    if bonus == True:

    m "When have I ever asked you to do something that I, Maya Makinami, am not personally at the forefront of?"

    "It’s not a solution, but it makes everything a lot less miserable and more...mysterious, I guess."
    "But, inside of this makeshift metaphor, we don’t even know the cliff is a cliff yet."

    "It could be something wonderful."

        "More than his mind, even."

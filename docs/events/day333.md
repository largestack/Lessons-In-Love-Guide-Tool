    a "Of course it is!"
    a "You know darn well that I wouldn’t even have a job if you’d just buy me everything I wanted {i}whenever{/i} I wanted it!"
    a "So excuse me for using my hard earned money to buy something that makes me look cute!"
    a "Our old uniforms were super ugly anyway. I feel a lot more confident in clothes that actually fit my adorable and lovable personality."
    m "You definitely look cuter in this. "
    m "It does feel a little strange seeing you in something different, though."
    m "I’d gotten rather used to the old uniforms."

    scene aminewuniform3
    with dissolve

    a "I...actually didn’t even realize we were allowed to change them until you suddenly showed up in that one day."
    m "And you didn’t find anything strange about all of the new girls having unique uniforms that didn’t at all match the ones we were given when we enrolled?"
    a "I..."
    s "Yeah, [kumon_mi_high] seems pretty lax with the dress code and I’m glad that we’re finally addressing this."

    scene aminewuniform4
    with dissolve

    m "It was bound to happen eventually."
    m "The[school] is okay with us wearing basically anything as long as there’s some sort of red or brown on it."
    s "But Yasu’s uniform is entirely black and white."
    m "Hm. I guess it is."
    m "Maybe it’s so staff members can identify that she has special needs?"
    s "That’s a little rude, don’t you think?"
    m "Not particularly, no."

    scene aminewuniform5
    with dissolve

    m "You’re happy with that, though?"
    a "I am. Totally."
    a "I’m also glad that I wasn’t the last one to actually {i}get{/i} a new uniform since a few of the other girls are still waiting on theirs."
    m "I see. "
    m "Does this mean you’ll be quitting your job at the maid cafe, then?"
    a "Hm? Why would I quit the maid cafe?"
    a "I actually kinda like it there."
    m "I just wasn’t sure if there was anything else you needed to save up money for since Sensei provides food and shelter for you and you’ve already gotten a good amount of new clothes."

        a "True. But I have to save up for when my boobs finally start growing and none of my old clothes fit me anymore."
    else:

    a "Woo! Sensei loves me and wants to squeeze me to death!"
    m "Good. Now that you’ve successfully managed to make me throw up in my mouth, would you mind explaining to me why you’re still here?"
    s "Because...you said you had something you wanted to talk about."
    m "That doesn’t sound like something I’d say."

    "She did."
    "Granted, it was still very early in the day when she told me, so it’s possible she could have been sleep talking or something..."
    "But there is absolutely no precedent for that, so I think it’s safe to assume she’s either just fucking with me or feigning ignorance."

    scene aminewuniform8
    with dissolve

    a "Is that why you can’t come to manga club today? Because you have to talk to Sensei about something?"
    m "No. I’m not coming to manga club because Molly keeps trying to get me to dress up in skin tight, revealing cosplay and Sensei is still in the building."
    s "So...you’d wear skin tight, revealing cosplay if I weren’t around?"

    scene aminewuniform9
    with dissolve

    m "Sure."
    m "And I have no trouble saying that I’d likely knock it out of the park as well. "
    m "I am quite attractive."

    if bonus == True:
        "I silently wish to myself that I had been reincarnated with invisibility."

    a "We could always just tell her to knock it off, you know..."

    scene aminewuniform10

    scene aminewuniform11
    with dissolve

    a "Ugh...fine. Permission granted."

    "I guess that’s a yes."

    a "But only because I know you’d never do something like stab me in the back and try to steal him away from me because we’re best friends and we love each other."
    m "I can assure you that there are many of your “possessions” that I would sooner steal from you than Sensei."
    s "Hey. Come on."

    scene aminewuniform12
    with dissolve

    a "Sensei, I have to leave for club now. But make sure you stay at least ten feet away from Maya at all times, okay?"

    "In doing so, she creates the very rare situation of Maya and I being alone in the classroom- a thing that...I actually can’t remember ever happening before."

    s "Have we ever been alone in the classroom before?"

    scene aminewuniform15
    with dissolve

    m "...Why?"
    s "I’m just curious."
    m "Okay, but why are you curious? Why would that ever be a thing that you need to ponder over? I don’t understand."
    s "Jesus Christ, sorry. It was just a question."
    m "...Whatever."

    "Maya breathes a heavy sigh and moves over to the window."
    "I contemplate whether or not I’m supposed to follow her, but-"

    m "It’s going to be hard to hear me if you stand all the way over there."

    "But she makes that decision for me and I proceed to join her."

    scene aminewuniform16
    with dissolve

    s "Sorry. I was just following the rules and trying to stay ten feet away from you at all times."
    m "Ha ha ha. As if you’d ever be able to follow a rule like that."
    s "Yes, Maya. You are irresistible and I can’t live without you."
    m "It’s coming."
    s "Wow, that was easy. All it took was a compliment to get you-"

    s "Well that’s significantly less fun."

    if bonus == True:
        m "Because it means there’s a chance for your personality to be wiped clean? Or because we’re not talking about sex?"
    else:
        m "Because it means there’s a chance for your personality to be wiped clean? Or because we’re not talking about hugs?"

    s "Both of them, but mostly the latter."
    m "Even in the face of death, you never cease to remind me of how disgusting you truly are."
    s "Well...it’s not really {i}death{/i} if I’m just replaced by someone else, right?"

    scene aminewuniform18
    with dissolve

    m "This might sound weird coming from me...but can you maybe try to value your existence a little more?"
    m "This is the first time a single iteration of you will be watching the world end for a third consecutive time."
    s "Wait, really? But I thought you said other Senseis have made it to winter before."
    m "Made it {i}to{/i}, yes. But none have ever made it to the second half of it."
    s "So it’s possible for my mind to be wiped before even {i}getting{/i} to the reset?"

    scene aminewuniform19
    with dissolve

    m "Sure. Just as it’s also possible for you to die in a more traditional sense."
    m "But I highly doubt you want to hear of all the times that has happened."
    s "Uhh...no, not really."
    m "The point is...I think you should try and stay focused on doing everything in your power to stay {i}who{/i} you are and {i}where{/i} you are as the current record holder."
    s "Because you’ll miss me when I’m gone?"

    scene aminewuniform20
    with dissolve

    m "Because the only thing a person like you would hate more than existing itself is {i}not{/i} existing."
    s "Deep."
    m "Shut up. You know what I mean."
    m "Just like how you also know you’re not ready to leave yet either."
    m "You’re having far too much fun running around and convincing a bunch of naive girls that they’re in love with you."
    s "How do you know that this is fun for me? Even I'm not sure if I'd use that word to describe it."
    m "Easy. I know you better than you know yourself."
    m "I’ve known you much {i}longer{/i} than you’ve known yourself, too, if my latest theory is correct. Which it probably is."

    if bonus == True:
        s "Just be careful not to come out and say any more than that. Because if I go into shock and you start trying to have sex with me in the classroom, it might cause some problems for-"
    else:
        s "Just be careful not to come out and say any more than that. Because if I go into shock and you start trying to force-hug me in the classroom, it might cause some problems for-"

    with dissolve

    m "Yes, yes. I know. "
    m "Forgive me for my momentary lapse in judgement as the world I knew came crumbling down around me."
    m "I can almost guarantee you that anyone in my shoes would have done the exact same thing."

    if bonus == True:
        s "I don’t know. I think you might just be a secret pervert."
        m "I’m not a secret pervert."
        s "How can I be so sure?"
        m "Because...I’m not. Now, can we please talk about the reset?"
    else:
        s "I don’t know. I think you might just like me."
        m "I do. I have always liked you. Please give me more attention and stop hugging other girls."
        s "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm no thanks."
        m "Fiojhsdfgouhsdiufghuasdfoisdf FINE let's just talk about the reset then."

    m "That {i}is{/i} the reason I called you here, after all."
    s "Fine, fine. "
    s "So, it’s coming and {i}I’ve{/i} never made it that far before. "
    s "Do you have some sort of plan or something that will help me...survive?"

    scene aminewuniform16
    with dissolve

    m "Hm..."
    m "I have one plan, but I don’t think you’ll like it."
    s "What is it?"
    m "Killing Noriko."
    s "Yeah, I don’t like that at all."
    s "I also don’t think that would change anything and that you’re just letting your grudge get the better of you again."
    m "Possibly. But I do think it would be better to be safe than sorry."
    s "Any plans that don’t involve killing one of your classmates?"

    scene aminewuniform20
    with dissolve

    m "Just to do things normally again, I suppose."
    m "Last time, I was an absolute idiot and let my mind get crowded during the process. Which may or may not have led to the destruction of an entire[school]."
    m "It’s still hard to tell if that was my fault or not. "
    m "But given that it was such an unusual change, I can’t help but hold myself at least slightly responsible."
    m "If everyone you’ve met over the last couple months {i}does{/i} disappear, though, know that I will not shed a single tear and that I would actually {i}prefer{/i} things that way."
    s "Really? Even after the dorm wars? "
    s "You won’t feel upset about all of your new friends just vanishing overnight?"
    m "Not really. "
    m "I’ve become rather exceptional at not getting attached to anything since my life has been reduced to near-quarterly looping through the same[school] year over and over and over."
    m "It’s incredibly exhausting, to tell you the truth."
    s "Well, hopefully I’m able to continue exhausting you in the future."
    s "It would kind of suck if things just ended here."

    scene aminewuniform22
    with dissolve

    m "Good. That’s exactly what I wanted to hear."
    m "Start treasuring your life. "
    m "Treasure it...but don’t do anything stupid with it either."
    m "It can be scary how fragile our existence is at times. "
    m "One wrong move and you might wind up back at the start."
    m "I hope things don’t come to that, though, because..."

    scene aminewuniform23
    with dissolve

    m "Well..."
    m "It would probably be a little {i}more{/i} exhausting having to explain everything over again from the beginning."
    m "You know basically just as much as I do now."
    m "Well, about the world and how it works, at least."
    m "There’s still plenty I know about your history that I can’t disclose without the fear of melting your brain."
    m "But life itself feels new again."
    m "Everything that’s happened recently is something I’ve never seen."
    m "And...it’s terrifying."

    scene aminewuniform20
    with dissolve

    m "But that’s enough of my expressive self for today."
    s "Really? You looked cute with your little smile just now."
    m "Shut up."
    m "I’ve warned you of the encroaching reset, so now it’s entirely on you to make it to the roof."
    s "Can you just meet me at my house next time?"
    m "Absolutely not. That is a horrible idea and never plays out the way I expect it to."
    m "Just save both of us some trouble and come to the roof on your own. "
    m "I’ll be waiting..."
    m "Just like always."

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "Maya goes to leave the classroom and I follow closely behind her."
    "Not because I’m trying to spend more time with her or anything, but because it would simply be strange for me to continue standing around here when the final bell rang nearly an hour ago."

    m "Stop following me."
    s "We’re both leaving[school], aren’t we? What’s the harm in walking together for a little while?"
    m "There is no {i}harm{/i}. It’s just not something I particularly enjoy."
    s "That’s fine. I’ll just walk silently behind you and admire you from the back then."
    m "You’re disgusting."

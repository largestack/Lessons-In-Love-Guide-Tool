    w "I want to fucking die."

    "It’s another normal day in Kumon-mi."
    "The snow is falling, the girls are off doing girl-stuff, and Wakana Watabe is talking about dying in my office."
    "That last one is a bit less common than the other two, but it’s slowly becoming yet another norm in my life."

    s "Do you need something?"
    w "A new job."
    s "Japan still has capital punishment, so you might be able to find a job as an executioner or something like that."
    w "Sounds absolutely wonderful."
    s "Really, though. Why are you here?"

    scene wakanaayaneoffice2

    if bonus == False:
        s "Of course not!"

    w "What could I possibly be interrupting right now?"
    s "I need to be ready to give slightly decent but also mildly self-destructive advice at any moment and you’re ruining my train of thought."
    w "Rub my feet."
    s "What? No."
    s "How did we get to that?"
    w "{i}You{/i} try standing and lecturing students all day and see how you feel. They fucking hurt."
    w "Rub them."
    s "I’m just a little surprised you’re even considering letting me touch you."

    with dissolve

    if bonus == True:
        w "Ugh. You’re not gonna fucking get off to it, are you?"
    else:
        w "Ugh. Relax. It's not like I'm asking you to hug me or whatever."

    w "I’ll just have Osako do it later if you’re going to be a fucking creep about it."

    if bonus == True:
        s "I’d like the record to reflect that I do not have a foot fetish before you go telling my karate instructor that I do."
    else:
        s "I'm always so nice to you and all you do is say mean things to me."

    scene wakanaayaneoffice4
    with dissolve

    w "Just kill me already."

    "Wakana kicks her shoes off and they go flying across the room, bouncing off of the wall before knocking a plant over."
    "It’s a plant I’ve never watered, so I’m kind of curious about how it’s still alive in the first place."
    "Maybe it’s fake?"

    w "I take it you’ve heard from Miyamura about the latest batch of miscreants, right?"
    s "I have not. This is the first I’m hearing about it."

    scene wakanaayaneoffice5
    with dissolve

    w "We? "
    w "{i}You{/i} were exempt from these ones for some fucking reason I have yet to comprehend."
    w "Meanwhile, they tossed a fucking anarchist and a girl who does nothing but write haiku into mine on Monday."
    s "Well those definitely sound like students that should have gone to me instead. I’m the one who handles all of the girls with weirdly specific personalities."
    w "Take them and give me Miyamura. That offer will literally always be there."
    s "If you can get Makoto to agree, sure. I have no problem with that. "
    s "I just can’t imagine she’d want to leave."

    "Frankly, I {i}would{/i} have a problem with Makoto leaving. "
    "I’m just so confident in her being around forever that the thought of her somehow disappearing has never even occurred to me."
    "Obviously not counting when the world ends, I mean."
    "But pretty much {i}everyone{/i} disappears for that, so..."

    scene wakanaayaneoffice6
    with dissolve

    if bonus == True:
        w "You’re right. I imagine you have a good amount of blackmail on her already, given how long she’s been around you."
        w "Such a shame to see a good girl like her led down the wrong path by someone with a shattered moral compass."
    else:
        w "She deserves better than the huggy boy."

    s "As much as I appreciate you coming into my office to insult me, I’d like to know if there’s some sort of...end point you’re trying to reach with this discussion."
    w "Everyone else is old and annoying. This is the only office I can take my shoes off inside of."
    w "We can just ignore each other if you’d prefer that."
    s "That would make me feel even stranger, to be completely honest."
    w "Then I guess we’re stuck with each other until I’m able to summon the strength to carry on with my life."
    s "Oh, good. So you’ll be in here for the rest of eternity."
    w "Probably."
    w "Send my regards to Osako. She’ll be wondering where I am when I don’t wash the dishes tonight."
    s "You actually do work around the house?"
    w "You should see me in an apron."
    s "You wear an {i}apron{/i}?"

    scene wakanaayaneoffice7
    with dissolve

    w "It was a joke, you fucking imbecile."
    w "Do you really think I’d spend the five seconds it would take to put an apron on instead of accepting that all clothes inevitably get dirty and need to be washed?"

        w "God, I wish."
    else:
        ay "On behalf of the Amamiya family, I humbly apologize. I give you full permission to chop off my pinky as punishment."

        ay "She's fine with it, though."

    scene wakanaayaneoffice11
    with dissolve

    ay "No, but it’s Ms. Watabe. She’s kind of infamous for not getting involved in anything outside of her paygrade."

    if bonus == True:
        ay "Therefore, I can say all the pervy stuff I want and everyone still wins."

    w "I want to fucking die."

    s "No...That you and Osako are dating."
    w "Is who I sleep with of that much importance to you?"
    s "I wouldn’t say {i}important{/i}, but..."
    w "But you want me to open up about my personal life because we're “friends” and “friends” tell each other things."

    scene wakanaayaneoffice3

    w "Oh."

    if bonus == True:
        w "A perverted reason."
        w "Why am I even remotely surprised?"
        w "First, you reveal your foot fetish. Now, you’re picturing me with my girlfriend. "
        ay "Foot fetish? "
        ay "Sensei, you should have told me you were into that sort of thing. I don’t mind doing a little experimenting."
        s "I don’t have a foot fetish, Ayane. "
        w "Deceiver. He nearly pounced on me when I asked him to massage my feet earlier."
    else:
        w "You want to become closer to me as a friend because, despite my demeanor, you find me interesting and require additional companionship to stave off your loneliness."
        s "Bingo."

    scene wakanaayaneoffice12
    with dissolve

    ay "You’re...that close with Ms. Watabe?"

        s "You are not pregnant, Ayane."
        ay "That’s what {i}you{/i} think."
        s "..."

    w "Come over here and massage my shoulders."
    s "Are your feet not tired anymore?"
    w "I don’t let people I barely know touch my feet. Shoulders are fine."
    s "Okay, I really have a hard time understanding how close we are, Wakana."

    scene wakanaayaneoffice14
    with dissolve

    ay "Obviously close enough to use her first name..."
    s "I use literally everyone’s first name. "
    ay "It’s different with older girls. They’re intimidating."

    "Wakana intimidates me, too, but...I’m pretty sure it’s in a slightly different way than it is for Ayane."

    scene wakanaayaneoffice15
    with fade

    w "Hah...yes..."
    w "Finally..."
    w "Actual...relaxation..."
    s "Why is Ayane doing this instead of me? This is very much up my alley."
    ay "You took too long, Sensei. Now it falls on me to help Ms. Watabe unwind."
    ay "Don’t tell our karate teacher I did this, though, or she won’t let me come to class anymore."
    w "If you even...have class...anymore..."
    w "The other...rich girl...is close to...finalizing the purchase of the dojo..."

    scene wakanaayaneoffice16
    with dissolve

    ay "Is that so?..."
    ay "That’s...okay, I guess."
    ay "I can always just find somewhere else to train..."
    ay "And if her dad thinks owning a dojo will make her happy...I can’t blame him for trying."
    s "Will Osako get to keep her job at least? "
    w "Beats me...ask her yourself..."
    w "We don’t...talk a lot about work..."
    s "I’ll make sure to fit that in between my questions about proper kick techniques and my formal apology for Ayane watching you two make out."

    scene wakanaayaneoffice17
    with dissolve

    ay "It was only for a few seconds. I doubt they even saw me."
    w "…"
    s "…"
    s "Going to weigh in on that, Ms. Watabe?"
    w "Nope."
    w "I don’t...care either way..."

    with dissolve

    w "Why are you still here?"
    s "This...is my office."
    ay "Shhh...getting stressed only causes more tension. "
    ay "And judging by how rough your shoulders feel, I’m pretty sure yelling at Sensei right now could paralyze you for life."
    w "That doesn’t sound all that bad. I could live off of government assistance and read all day."
    s "But then who would mold the minds of all of the willing and impassioned students in your class?"

    if bonus == True:
        w "Anyone with access to a fucking textbook and the ability to keep their hands to themselves."
    else:
        w "Anyone with access to a fucking textbook."

    s "…"
    ay "…"
    w "Oh, right. I forgot how fucked up things are in Class A."

    if bonus == True:
        w "Just a textbook will suffice, then."
        w "For most students, at least. "
    else:
        w "What kind of fucking college professor employs the Montessori strategy and just teaches through anarchy?"

    scene wakanaayaneoffice19
    with dissolve

    if bonus == True:
        w "But then, along come the anarchists and the poets and, what do you know, you’ve suddenly got an even more obnoxious class to teach than you did just last week."
    else:
        w "It's no surprise that it's breeding a whole new group of anarchists and poets and- what do you know? You’ve suddenly got an even more obnoxious class to teach than you did just last week."

    ay "I think all of the new students might be getting to Ms. Watabe."
    s "I think Ms. Watabe was done long before the new students started showing up."
    w "I want to fucking die."
    ay "Sensei, are we going to be getting any more? "
    ay "Fourteen is a weird number and I’m pretty sure the other classes have more than double that."
    w "The other classes also have teachers."
    s "She’s got a point."
    w "You’ll...hah...get more..."
    w "And if...for some god forsaken reason...you don’t..."

    ay "Soon, you’ll be back at home with my karate teacher and all of your bath towels- making out and washing each other's hair in the shower."
    w "We shower...alone..."

    if bonus == True:
        ay "That’s a waste of water and you should reconsider. "
        ay "I shower with my friends all the time and it’s truly a wonderful bonding experience."

        "I need to figure out a way to get into the dorm showers."
        "Hopefully on a day that Maya or Yumi aren’t there as I would like to leave with all of my limbs still attached..."

    "The three of us remain in the office for another hour or so before we decide it’s time to head home."
    "Well, Ayane and I decide that."
    "Wakana, still winding down from Ayane’s rather enticing shoulder massage, elects to take a nap on the couch and agrees to lock the place up once she leaves in another hour or two."
    "Not that I care if she even locks up in the first place."

    if bonus == True:
        "Like, who is going to raid my office after hours in a[school] that also happens to be locked?"
        "And even if someone does, it’s not like I’m keeping evidence of my sexual relationships here."
        "But I digress."
        "The true takeaways from today are as follows:"
        "Wakana is a lesbian. (Or bisexual.)"
        "So is my karate instructor."
        "Oh, and I’m also probably going to be getting new students soon."
        "But the most important takeaways are the first two."
        "Unless the new students are cute."
        "Then all three takeaways are important."

    "It’s day-two of helping my new students move into their dorms and, today, I’m accompanied by none other than Miku and Futaba."
    "And when I say “I’m accompanied,” it’s really closer to me accompanying them."
    "Tsuneyo didn’t actually invite me to help, I just heard about it in class and decided to show up unannounced."
    "But hey, virtually every visit I’ve had to the dorms has been unannounced so far. Might as well not do anything to break the streak."

    s "Hey. What are you two up to?"

    scene tsuneyomoves2
    with dissolve

    mi "Oh, hey Sensei! I didn’t know you were comin’ today!"
    s "Neither did I, to be honest. Just sort of happened."
    f "Are you here to help Tsuneyo move as well?"
    s "You know it. Anything I can do to help."
    s "Does sitting around drinking water really constitute helping, though? It doesn’t seem like you’re doing much."

    scene tsuneyomoves3
    with dissolve

    mi "Hey! Watch it! We did plenty of stuff before you got here! "
    mi "God forbid we take a second to drink some water. Jeez, kids these days!"
    f "Please forgive her tone, Sensei...Miku’s actually worked really hard today."
    mi "That’s heckin’ right, I have. And so has Futaba! We’ve carried like a bajillion different boxes and like, 90%% of ‘em have been clothes!"
    f "I’ve...done my best. I can’t exactly carry as much as Miku."

    scene tsuneyomoves4
    with dissolve

    mi "Yeah, but that’s probs just cause those big ole’ honkers keep gettin’ in the way."
    f "That’s not...entirely incorrect. I wish you’d be a little less abrasive, though."

    scene tsuneyomoves5
    with dissolve

    mi "Sensei! Translation request! The heck does ‘abrasive’ mean?"
    s "It means Futaba wants you to be a little less candid when you talk about her chest."
    mi "Oooooh. I see, I see."
    mi "The heck does ‘candid’ mean?"
    s "It means that you shouldn’t make fun of Futaba’s boobs."

    scene tsuneyomoves6
    with dissolve

    mi "I ain’t makin’ fun of em! I’d kill for those puppies! I’m not even wearin’ a friggin bra right now."
    f "And I’d kill to be able to do that..."

    if bonus == True:
        "Ahh, I’ve reached the point of my life where my students are no longer concerned with talking about their chests in front of me."
        "Hard work really does pay off."
    else:
        s "This conversation is quickly devolving into something I do not want to be involved in, so I am going to cut both of you off right here."
        mi "Aww, come on! It was all in good fun!"

    scene tsuneyomoves7
    with dissolve

    if bonus == True:
        s "Sorry, you two. But as much as I’d like to stay and talk about boobs with you, would you mind telling me where Tsuneyo is?"
    else:
        s "Sorry, you two. But it is very important to me to maintain a reasonable distance from the two of you at all times. Additionally, would anyone mind telling me where Tsuneyo is?"

    s "I feel like I’m obligated to at least try to help her tonight."

    if bonus == True:
        "That and I’d also like her to be a part of this conversation as well. I haven’t seen much of Tsuneyo, but I definitely think her body is rather...developed for her age."

    mi "Hm? You blind, Sensei? She’s right behind ya."
    s "Wait, really?"

    "I turn around and-"

    scene tsuneyomoves8
    with dissolve

    s "…"
    t "…"
    s "Hi, Tsuneyo."
    t "Ah-"
    s "Do you need help with those boxes?"
    t "I’m fine."
    t "I have to carry much heavier things at the restaurant."
    s "Yes, but I’m sure you can normally {i}see{/i} when you carry those things."
    t "That is a good point."
    s "So can I take a box then?"
    t "Sure."

    scene tsuneyomoves9
    with dissolve

    "Tsuneyo’s expressionless face pops into my vision as I take a box full of her clothes from the top of the stack."

    t "Hello."
    s "Hey."
    t "Come here often?"
    s "Are you hitting on me right now?"
    t "I don’t think so."
    s "Really? Because it sounds a lot like you’re hitting on me."
    t "I don’t even know what that means."
    s "That aside, how are you feeling about the move? Have you gotten used to Molly yet?"

    scene tsuneyomoves10
    with dissolve

    t "…"
    s "…"

    "Tsuneyo looks off to the side instead of answering my question."
    "I assume this means she-"

    t "Is that a bird?"
    s "What?"

    scene tsuneyomoves11
    with dissolve

    s "Is that thing really still there? I figured it would have left by now."

    scene tsuneyomoves10
    with dissolve

    t "We should give it a name."
    s "You want to name a bird that’s probably going to fly away in a day or two?"
    t "You don’t?"
    s "…"
    s "No, I kind of do as well."
    t "Let’s name him Noodles."
    s "You need interests besides noodles, Tsuneyo."

    scene tsuneyomoves12
    with dissolve

    t "Fuck you."

    "WOAH."
    "Where the hell did that come from?"

    s "Uhh...did I do something to offend you?"
    t "The only thing that offends me is when someone only eats half of their dinner."
    t "You haven’t eaten dinner. You are fine."
    s "Then why did you curse at me?"

    scene tsuneyomoves13
    with dissolve

    t "Curse? What does that mean?"
    s "You said “Fuck you” just now. The word “fuck” is a curse. "

    play sound "thump.mp3"
    scene tsuneyomoves14
    with hpunch

    t "Oh no. What have I done?"

    "Tsuneyo suddenly drops her boxes on the floor in front of her. A loud thud rings out and likely echoes throughout the first dorm floor."

    s "Tsuneyo, your computer was in one of those boxes..."
    t "Are you going to die?"
    s "What? Why would I die?"
    t "The curse."
    s "...It’s not that kind of curse."

    scene tsuneyomoves15
    with dissolve

    t "So...you will live?"
    s "I will very much live."

    scene tsuneyomoves16
    with dissolve

    t "I’ve been bestowed with too much power..."
    s "I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about."

    scene tsuneyomoves17
    with dissolve

    t "That curse was taught to me by the Emerald Guardian. "
    s "Tsuneyo, it’s not that kind of curse."
    t "Even if it is a weak curse, I shouldn’t have placed it on you."
    t "I am sorry. You may eat for free at my family’s shop whenever you like for the rest of your life."
    s "No, that’s fine. I’ll still pay."
    t "No."
    s "Yes..."
    t "No."
    s "Tsuneyo."

    scene tsuneyomoves18
    with dissolve

    t "Ah-"
    mi "Ay! The heck are you two doin’ over there? And why’d ramen-girl drop her computer on the ground?"
    mi "You gotta be careful with loud noises like that! You never know who might freak out and get scared from ‘em."

    scene tsuneyomoves19
    with dissolve

    "I turn around to find an uncharacteristically angry looking Miku, though I imagine I know why."
    "The only time I’ve ever seen her lose her composure was after that ball hit the storage room that one time."
    "I guess I should be glad that she didn’t have another reaction like that now. "
    "I was lucky enough that Karin was around last time. I have no idea how I’d be able to handle something like that alone."

    scene tsuneyomoves20
    with dissolve

    t "I’m very sorry for the disturbance. I had no idea a computer could make that kind of noise."

    "It’s not like it’s {i}supposed{/i} to..."

    mi "I’m not mad at you. I’m mad at {i}him{/i}."
    s "…"
    s "Wait, me? What did I do?"
    mi "I don’t know her enough to get mad at her yet. I gotta take it out on somebody."
    mi "Drop and give me twenty, mister."
    s "I am absolutely not going to do that."

    scene tsuneyomoves21
    with dissolve

    mi "Fine! Futaba! Drop and give me twenty!"
    f "What?! Twenty sounds like a lot...I don’t even know if I could do that many..."

    scene tsuneyomoves22
    with dissolve

    t "I will accept this punishment...It is the least I can do."
    mi "Hm? Hey, wait a sec Tsuneyo. You don’t have to-"

    scene tsuneyomoves23
    with dissolve

    mi "And now she’s doing it."

    "Tsuneyo quickly drops to the floor and begins to do push-ups. "
    "She’s surprisingly quick too..."
    "I wonder if she works out often?"

    s "You need to watch what you say around her, Miku. I don’t think Tsuneyo is...all there just yet."
    f "She’s...really good at those..."
    mi "Well how the heck was I supposed to know? No one’s ever actually listened to me when I’ve said that before! Not even the girls on the team!"
    s "From what she’s told me, she’s been pretty sheltered most of her life, so I’d imagine there are some other cues she’d miss out on as well."
    t "...Twenty."

    scene tsuneyomoves24
    with dissolve

    t "The curse has been lifted."
    mi "Curse?..."
    t "The curse I placed on Sensei."
    s "Molly taught her the F word."

    scene tsuneyomoves25
    with dissolve

    f "The F word? You mean...fuck?"
    t "…"
    s "… "
    mi "…"

    scene tsuneyomoves26
    with dissolve

    t "Dear God...not again..."
    t "What have I done?"

    scene tsuneyomoves27
    with dissolve

    "Tsuneyo drops to the floor and, once again, attempts to break the curse..."

    t "One...two...three-"
    mi "Jeez. You weren’t wrong about that whole pickin’ up on cues thing."
    f "This one...is definitely my fault..."

    scene black
    with dissolve

    "Today’s move-in operation ended on a significantly less successful note than the last one."
    "But even with that being said, it seemed like Tsuneyo and the others were able to get most of the work done before I even showed up."
    "And while I’m not exactly sure what became of the computer she dropped on the ground, I do know that pretty much everything else she owned made it into her room undamaged."
    "It’s a shame I haven’t gotten to see the inside of the dorm yet, but I imagine I’ll be able to soon enough..."
    "I just need to spend a little more time with her and Molly."

    mi "Sensei! Sensei! Guess what!"

    "My morning begins the same way as always- with a small girl running up to me and begging for some time alone with my penis."

    s "Hah...fine. But we can’t do it in the classroom and will have to use my office."

    mi "Office? What? Am I in trouble?"
    s "No. I just got ahead of myself and misinterpreted whatever it is you’re looking for. But go ahead, Miku. I will allow you to talk as an apology for my...incorrectness."
    mi "Why’re you bein’ so weird today?"
    s "It’s my hot boy summer. I’m allowed."

    mi "Well, I’ve got no idea what the heck ya mean by that, but I’ve got some great news! "
    s "Great for me or great for you? Because those are two very different things."
    mi "Both of us!"
    mi "Great for me because I won’t be so bored anymore...and great for you since you won’t have to do all of that paperwork you’re always complainin’ about!"
    s "Wait...does that mean-"

    scene returnofthemakoto3
    with dissolve

    mi "Makoto’s waitin’ in the hall right now. Maki drove the two of us to school today after takin’ us out for breakfast."
    s "She’s finally ready?"

    scene returnofthemakoto4
    with dissolve

    mi "Wanna come see for yourself? Figured you’d wanna talk to her anyway. "
    mi "Plus, she’s trying to keep everything lowkey right now- which would give me time to go around and remind everybody not to say anything that might upset her."
    s "I don’t really want to go out there if she’s not expecting me to come out. The two of us left off in...kind of a weird spot."
    mi "She {i}is{/i} expectin’ you, though. And, as her best friend, I can safely say she’d probs be a lot more comfortable comin’ back to class knowin’ you’ll be by her side."
    s "I haven’t been by her side at all. And while I’m obviously not blaming myself for what happened, I can’t imagine I helped in any way."
    mi "Well, why are you sayin’ all of that to me? Ain’t no way I’m gonna remember it. Just come out in the hallway and tell it to her straight while I work my Miku magic."

    "So...Makoto is back."
    "I guess now is as good a time as any with the class suddenly abuzz about Halloween being right around the corner."
    "But...then again, I worry that might evoke some unhelpful memories for Makoto as I don’t exactly have a history of being “kind” to her on that day."
    "Maybe I’m looking back on that first Halloween with tinted glasses and Makoto doesn’t feel as broken up about it as I have recently."
    "But I’ve already decided-"
    "I am going to be better to her."
    "I’m going to stop pretending I understand what she needs as I’ve been nothing but wrong this whole time and look where that’s gotten us."
    "And sure, it’s easy to say that now that she’s jumped the biggest hurdle she’ll ever face- but being late is better than never showing up at all."
    "And sometimes it takes a horrible tragedy for us to find out what’s important."

    "Miku runs back into the classroom, leaving me alone with Makoto’s body and the seed of grief that has taken root within it."
    "She looks mostly the same. Her {i}voice{/i} is mostly the same- just maybe an octave deeper. "
    "But the way she stares down at the ground when she talks...the way she nervously grips her suspenders and...blinks at an elevated rate as if she’s been stricken with some sort of ocular arrhythmia-"
    "None of that is her."
    "Or the old her, at least."
    "I still have to get to know this new one."

    s "No. But I expect to prove it to you."

    mak "Is this you pretending to be nice to me or something?"
    s "I’m not pretending. I really do want to start taking it easy on you. "
    mak "By taking away something I actually like doing?"
    s "Do you actually {i}like{/i} doing all of that work? Or do you just like being of use to me?"
    mak "Both."
    s "Oh."
    s "Then, by all means. But this gesture of mine should not go unnoticed since I’ve been actively dreading having to say all of that to you."

    scene returnofthemakoto12
    with dissolve

    mak "Thank you, Sensei. Though, I’d like to give this “nice” side of yours a little more time to settle in as I have a hard time comprehending exactly what that entails."
    s "It entails not taking advantage of you anymore, for one."
    mak "Does that include or exclude sexual contact?"
    s "Hopefully, it excludes it. I quite enjoy having sex with you. Which is a thing I probably shouldn’t be saying in the hall during school hours, but hey. "
    mak "Daring as ever, I see."

    "Then, like second nature, she retreats to her desk and removes a notebook that I assume has been sitting in there since she was called down to the front office."
    "I wonder what the last thing she wrote is."
    "I wonder if the page she’s looking at right now has anything written on it at all...or if she’s just trying to make it {i}look{/i} like she’s reading so no one bothers her."
    "As you may have expected, there’s a brief moment of silence as the rest of the girls glance over at her in unison."
    "But the silence clears up when Miku stares back at them."
    "And within less than a minute, it’s like nothing ever changed."

    u "Bingo."
    u "Just to make sure, though...Operation: Phoenix is code for the second annual Super Mega Ultimate Dorm Wars, right?"
    ay "Right. Because the first one was Operation: Firestarter and the fire ended when the contest did. And Phoenixes are made of fire or something and then rise from the ashes."
    ay "So obviously, the second annual Super Mega Ultimate Dorm Wars have to involve Phoenixes in some way."
    u "You put a lot of thought into that. I like it. Gives me extra fodder for when I beat your ass again this year."

    ay "Thanks, Imani. You’re always so uplifting."
    ima "So, this face-off thing...what’s the deal? What’s going on?"

    ima "I can finally wear a school uniform without anyone telling me I’m being inappropriate."

    ima "Let me judge the Dorm Wars with you!"
    s "The Dorm Wars? Are we doing that again?"
    ima "Either that or I am being hazed and deceived! And I’m pretty sure everybody likes me too much at this point to haze me!"
    s "What if our decision is split and we choose different people?"

    "Imani (Who is much faster than me) quickly tracks me down, but stops pressing on the matter of “unofficial bonus contests” when her adult brain sends her a signal as to what that might mean."
    "I support her decision to slip into blissful ignorance but, despite having agreed to it already, I’m not quite sure how I feel about her decision to join me as a judge."
    "In an ideal world, she’d team up with all of the other adults I know for a mega three-tiered battle in which they create their own {i}third{/i} floor, but..."
    "Actually, that sounds like pure chaos."
    "The bonus contests would probably be fun, though."
    "Assuming there...are any of them this year, that is."
    "But hey, there’s only one way to find out and it sounds like it’s right around the corner at this point."
    "All that’s left to do is wait and..."
    "Worry about what will happen to me if I am once again split between ten girls crammed into a small room."

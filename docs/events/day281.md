        s "…"

        "Or, I could completely luck out and her final condition could just be sleeping with her or something."

    else:
        s "A hug."

    scene nodokaoffice3
    with dissolve

    if bonus == True:
        no "You don’t need to. The fact that you’re unwilling to tell me means that it’s likely something sexual in nature, to which I must refuse."

    else:
        no "Sure. I have time for a hug."
        s "Wait, no. Now I'm nervous."

    scene nodokaoffice4

    else:
        s "What is it, then? And why should I have to go out on a limb for you when all you bring to the table is negative energy?"

    scene nodokaoffice5

    no "Who says that is all I have to bring to the table?"
    no "I come to you today with a proposition, Sensei."
    no "A chance to turn multiple lives around {i}and{/i} improve the state of our class all through one menial task."
    s "How menial?"
    no "Kidnapping."
    s "No."

    scene nodokaoffice6

    no "No?"
    s "Did you think I was just going to agree to kidnapping someone?"
    no "I thought you’d at least {i}think{/i} about it."
    s "What? No. How would kidnapping someone help improve the state of our class in the first place?"

    scene nodokaoffice7

    no "By turning it into a {i}paradise...{/i}"

    no "…"
    s "Okay, listen. You haven’t transferred in yet, but I’ll let you know now that our class isn’t exactly a {i}normal{/i} class."

    no "In fact, if it weren’t for the information I received from her, I never would have come up with this idea in the first place."
    s "You’re going to have to explain a little better than that."

    scene nodokaoffice8
    with dissolve

    no "No. I will not."
    s "Then I won’t do whatever it is-"

    s "Noriko, do you have any idea what Rin means by this?"
    s "And wait, since when do you two even talk to each other?"
    n "Since a few minutes ago."
    n "I’m not supposed to be here, but I came to see what you were doing and she was just...standing in the hall looking all determined and stuff."
    r "Determination! Dreams!"
    s "Yes, Rin. I understand."

    scene nodokaoffice10
    with dissolve

    no "Noriko? This is the class you transferred into after Miss Watabe’s? "
    no "I was certain they were just kicking you out of[school]."
    n "Nope! Just putting me back where I belong!"
    no "Have you already been notified of what’s going on right now?"
    n "More or less. I know Otoha is involved and that’s enough to count me in."
    s "Otoha? The musician girl?"

    "Well that certainly explains why Rin looks like...that."

    scene nodokaoffice11
    with dissolve

    no "Precisely. "
    no "I want you to kidnap Otoha Okakura, ensure that she winds up in your class, and convert the[school] into the ultimate yuritopia."
    r "Yuritopia!"
    s "I get why Rin would want that, but why would you make something like this a condition?"
    n "Aren’t you going to ask me how I know Otoha?"
    s "I just assumed it was through your sister."

    scene nodokaoffice12
    with dissolve

    n "Nope! We used to be in a band together."
    n "Cool, right?"
    r "Yuritopia!"
    no "To get back on track, the reason that I’m making this a “condition” is that I’ve been quite worried about Otoha’s well-being lately."
    no "She doesn’t fare well-being cooped up in her house with overbearing parents all day so, as her friend, rescuing her is currently my top priority."

    scene nodokaoffice13
    with dissolve

    r "Yeah. Yuri stuff aside, Otoha’s seemed really drained lately. "
    r "And I’ve already been talking to her about transferring over for a while...but she’s still on the fence for some reason."
    r "I figure that if we could make sure she winds up in our class, though, she’ll definitely do it."
    r "And since her and Nodoka are friends already, the two of them could room together."
    no "The groundwork has already been laid, Sensei. It now falls on you to ensure the rest of the building is built."
    s "…"
    s "Why {i}me?{/i}"
    s "What can I do that you guys can’t?"
    s "I’ve barely even talked to Otoha."

    scene nodokaoffice14
    with dissolve

    no "Absolutely nothing!"
    s "…"
    s "Why do you look so proud in saying that?"

    scene nodokaoffice15
    with dissolve

    no "Because the solution is quite simple."
    no "I believe the main reason that Otoha is afraid of transferring[school]s is because she can’t guarantee her grades will remain high enough to spend her free time as she pleases."

    if bonus == True:
        no "The transition to homeschooling has already negatively impacted her GPA, and she is now on the cusp of having to retire as a musician until she is out of [high_school]."
    else:
        no "Despite being an adult woman, her parents tricked her into signing away her rights via conservatorship to them, kind of like what happened with Britney Spears."

    no "As a fellow prodigy and the ultimate friend, I refuse to let talent like hers go to waste."
    no "So where {i}you{/i} come in is ensuring her that her grades will remain safe and secure in this new environment. "
    no "Also, I need reference material for something I’m writing and want to closely study any potential relationship (Or lack thereof) including her and my new assistant here."
    s "This isn’t exactly “kidnapping,” Nodoka."
    no "If she vehemently refuses to comply, I am not against binding her and tossing her into the back of your car."
    s "I don’t have a car."
    no "Well then we should hope Plan A succeeds so you don’t need to obtain one."
    s "And I take it that you two are in complete agreement with all aspects of this plan?"

    scene nodokaoffice16
    with dissolve

    n "I like Plan B more. But yeah, it would be cool to have Otoha around again. She’s super chill."
    r "I like both plans, but I’m pretty sure you already know that by now."
    s "Yeah, I don’t know why I included you at all."
    no "Is it settled, then? You’ll accompany us on an excursion to steal her?"
    s "Wait, I actually have to {i}go{/i} somewhere?"
    no "Futaba informed me that your affinity for cute girls is the only reason you travel in the first place, so I figured it would be fine."
    s "It is. I’m just obligated to complain about things that require me exerting any amount of effort."
    n "Want me to just go tie her up and bring her here in your place? "
    n "I can probably borrow one of the 567 cars."
    n "I don’t know how to drive yet, but I’m sure I’m smart enough to figure it out."
    s "When is this trip exactly?"
    no "Does tomorrow work for you? Otoha has free time after her lessons on Wednesday that she usually spends in a park near our old[school]."
    r "Nodoka and I already planned on going to see her, but if you came too I’m sure we could get her to agree to at least try it out."
    no "Again, the trick is to really just hammer in that her grades won’t be an issue."
    s "I feel like you three are really taking advantage of how horrible of a teacher I am right now."

    scene nodokaoffice17
    with dissolve

    n "Hey, don’t call yourself horrible. You’re just going through some stuff right now."
    n "You’ve helped me a lot, remember?"
    r "You’ve helped me a lot too, but like...I don’t know if I’d really call you a “good” teacher or whatever."

    if bonus == True:
        no "I honestly don’t care. I only come here out of obligation. I’ve already been pre-accepted to the college of my choice."
    else:
        no "I honestly don’t care. I only come here out of obligation. I’m just trying to save up enough money to go to Disneyland."

    "Have fun {i}getting{/i} there, though."

    s "Sure, I’ll come with you tomorrow. "
    s "There are no hidden caveats to any of this, though, right? "
    s "I don’t want to agree to taking in Otoha as well only to find that I’m going to need to like, pay for her phone bill or something."
    s "My plan maxes out at five lines and I’m already there."

    scene nodokaoffice18
    with dissolve

    r "Why are you paying for five phone lines?"
    n "Did you figure out a way to clone Ami?"
    s "Don’t worry about it."
    r "…"
    n "…"
    n "Me or Rin? Because we had two very different questions and I would like my own Ami clone if that's okay with you."
    s "Both of you..."
    no "There are no hidden caveats, but I do urge you to consider just how happy it would make all three of us if you were to agree."
    no "Also, you will be cordially invited to our first joint slumber party as a reward for your cooperation."

    if bonus == True:
        s "Say no more. I’m in."

    r "Tentatively!"
    r "I’ll probably find a way to ruin it!"
    s "You know, I’ve seen some strange things in here, but this is probably among the strangest."
    no "Shhhhh...read the room. We’re having a moment right now."
    s "But it’s...{i}my{/i} room."

    "Nodoka, on the other hand, feels the need to stay behind for some reason..."

    no "You did a good thing today, Sensei."
    no "There’s more to you than just rants about manipulation and impure thoughts, isn’t there?"
    s "Not much else, but yeah. I can do something nice every once in a while, I guess."
    no "Well it earned you a handful of Nodoka points. Good job."
    s "Nodoka points?"
    no "The Nodoka currency. You can use them to redeem Nodoka rewards."
    s "How many do I have?"
    no "Five. But I won't be stingy in handing them out, so I'm sure you'll be rolling in them before you know it."
    s "Is there any reward I can buy with five points?"
    no "Are you sure you don’t want to save them up for something better?"
    s "I don’t even know what the rewards are yet."

    "So I guess today was all sorts of weird."

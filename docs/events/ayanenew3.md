    "The day came to an end a long time ago and I still haven’t left."
    "Which, of course, means that Ayane hasn’t left either as staying late with me under the guise of cleaning duty is the type of convenient excuse a girl like her lives for."
    "No cleaning was done today, as you have probably guessed."
    "In fact, not much of anything was done today."
    "Time ticked by and the sun disappeared without much of anything happening at all."
    "And something about the way the light of the moon pierces the window and lands on me erases any chance I have to contemplate how or why that happened."
    "I’m just here."
    "Ayane is here too, but the main thing is that {i}I’m{/i} here."

    s "..."
    ay "..."

    "I’m here."
    "This is my world now."
    "And despite the irrational thoughts that have been crawling through every inch of...whatever section of the brain creates what is {i}supposed{/i} to be rational thought-"
    "Despite that, I am here."
    "Alone, even with the warm body of a young girl beside me."

    ay "It’s beautiful, isn’t it?"
    s "What is?"
    ay "The sky...The moon...All of it."
    ay "There’s something really magical about looking up at the stars on a hot summer night."
    ay "It’s just one of those things that makes your mind and your body go, “Ahh...youth!” "
    ay "You know?"
    s "..."

    "It would be nice to leech such trivial, little thoughts from whatever it is that causes celestial bodies to glow. "
    "It’s something about energy, I’m assuming- which may partially explain the second wind Ayane is feeling all of a sudden."
    "I wonder if this light would have the same effect on me if it were not for the transparent barrier I hide behind."

    ay "Is something going on, Sensei?"
    s "..."
    ay "You’ve been acting off ever since school ended. And I’ve got a feeling that whatever it is runs a little deeper than just exhaustion."
    ay "Do you want to talk about it?"
    s "There’s not really anything {i}to{/i} talk about. I feel the same as always."
    ay "Is that supposed to reassure me? Because it really just makes it sound like you’re putting on some sort of front all the time."
    ay "Like...you’re pretending to be someone you’re not."
    s "..."
    ay "..."

    scene ayanenewthree2
    with dissolve

    ay "Well, if you change your mind, I’ll be right beside you."
    ay "You already know that I’d do anything for you, so consider me staying a little later today as one more testament in Ayane Amamiya’s love bible."
    s "If anyone else asks, we’re going to have to stick to the cleaning duty excuse. “Love Bible” doesn’t sound like a legitimate excuse."
    ay "To be honest, I doubt anyone would believe any sort of excuse we gave them to explain me staying after school with you, Sensei."
    ay "This might be a little hard to believe, but my love for you is pretty widely understood among us girls."
    s "I’m surprised Ami showed no resistance to this if that’s the case."
    ay "I don’t think it’s {i}that{/i} surprising. Especially considering that Ami probably noticed something was wrong as well."
    s "Nothing is wrong, though."
    ay "Then I guess Ami was okay with it because she noticed {i}nothing{/i} was wrong."
    ay "I know I obsess over you literally all the time, but I know when I should stop. And I think that even if Ami wishes I’d flirt with you a little less...that she trusts me with your heart."
    s "That’s a bad move. I don’t even trust you with my heart."

    scene ayanenewthree3
    with dissolve

    ay "You don’t?"
    s "Of course not. It’s nothing personal, though, since there’s not anyone I would trust with something as important as that."
    s "It might sound romantic to some people to have someone they can be open and honest with but, to me, that sounds-"

    scene ayanenewthree4
    with dissolve

    ay "I get it. I really do."
    ay "Maybe not 100%%, but I can relate to the whole “Not wanting to open up to someone” thing."
    s "You say, despite opening up way too much to me almost every single day."
    ay "Ahh, there’s the difference, Sensei. The door you’re referring to was left open for way too long and doesn’t close anymore."
    ay "But there are plenty of other doors in my house that lead to different rooms...and I doubt that I’d open those up to even you right now."
    s "Then I guess you {i}can{/i} relate in some way."

    scene ayanenewthree2
    with dissolve

    ay "Of course I can. I’m your future wife."
    ay "And I’m sure there will be plenty of nights in the future where the two of us gather beneath the stars- sharing all sorts of worries or secrets or...anything we want to share with one another."
    ay "It’s just a little hard for us right now since the real stuff will just come across as annoying."
    s "You’re a lot more perceptive than you look, Ayane."
    ay "Are you calling me ugly?"
    s "What? No."
    ay "Good. Because if you were calling me ugly, I would throw myself out of this window."
    s "Please don’t. That sounds like an incredibly stressful situation to deal with."
    s "And I guess..."
    s "I might miss you a little if you were gone."

    scene ayanenewthree5
    with dissolve

    ay "..."
    ay "Did you just-"
    s "Nope."
    ay "I could have sworn I just heard you say something actually romantic for...probably the first time ever."
    s "Is saying I’d miss you {i}a little{/i} really that romantic?"

    scene ayanenewthree6
    with dissolve

    ay "You {i}did{/i} say it! Oh my God! I wish Ami was here to see this!"
    s "I feel like that would significantly increase the chances of you ending up as a puddle of flesh and blood on the concrete below us."

    scene ayanenewthree7
    with dissolve

    ay "Then, at least I would die happy..."

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "The night gets darker and the reasons we have to stick around reduce to somewhere near zero."
    "But even with that in mind, the two of us feel a shared inclination to go higher rather than lower."
    "And I follow Ayane as she begins to move toward the wrong set of stairs."
    "........."
    "......"
    "..."

    scene ayanenewthree8
    with dissolve2

    "I continue following her until we can go no higher."
    "Through an unlocked door and onto the roof of the school-"
    "Up a ladder, then another-"
    "And before long, we are free to look down on everything and everyone."
    "That power is quickly diminished and made irrelevant by the simple fact that I can see nothing from up here."
    "But still-"
    "Something about it allows me to relax my shoulders."
    "I am more unguarded when closer to death than I am in the safety of my own home."
    "Ayane speaks again. "
    "Her words cut through the haze of a trillion dying lights."

    ay "This is a lot better, don’t you think?"
    s "I guess. It’s a little hot, though."
    ay "{i}You’re{/i} a little hot, though."
    s "Hilarious."
    ay "Hey! I’ll have you know that I consistently rank among the top ten funniest girls in our class based on the polls I force Sana to run online."
    s "I’m honestly amazed that she hasn’t asked for a new roommate yet."
    ay "And {i}I’m{/i} honestly amazed by {i}how hot you are.{/i}"
    s "Ayane, please."
    ay "Sorry. I’m done now."
    ay "For real, though. Doesn’t it feel much better up here?"
    ay "I’ve never actually been on the roof of the school before- just heard about it from Ami. But my bedroom at home did have a window I could climb out of and sit on the roof."
    ay "I remember doing that a lot after my mom left."
    ay "And I guess it became some sort of coping mechanism for me or something like that since I’m still compelled to climb as high as I can whenever I’m feeling down."
    ay "Even your worries seem smaller when you’re this far off the ground."
    ay "And I’m not saying that the reason I brought you up here is to try and force the way I handle things on you-"
    ay "I just thought it might be a little easier to breathe in a place with more air."
    s "..."
    ay "..."
    s "That line would have been a lot better if higher altitudes didn’t make it {i}harder{/i} to breathe. "
    ay "Ooh! Maybe we should just have class on the roof from now on if being up here is going to help you remember cool facts like that?"
    s "Thank you, Ayane."
    s "Not for your sarcastic teaching comment, but for looking out for me even when you probably shouldn’t be."
    ay "..."
    s "..."
    ay "You’re welcome, Sensei."
    ay "You were there for me, so I’ll be here for you."
    ay "I didn’t expect you to actually thank me, though. It’s not really like you to lean into serious moments like this."
    ay "But I guess we all act a little differently when we’re on top of the world."
    ay "Oh! Here’s a fun idea. How about we take turns admitting some of our deepest, darkest secrets to one another? That’ll help kill some time before we head back, won’t it?"
    s "I’m good. I don’t really have anything I’m actively hiding from you anyway."
    ay "What? Really? Well, that’s no fun."
    ay "I guess we’ll just have to have sex instead, then."
    s "..."
    ay "..."

    "Wait, what?"

    s "Was that for real? Because it’s hard to tell with you sometimes."
    ay "Yeah. It was."
    ay "I’m a little nervous, but...I think I’m ready."
    ay "Assuming you’re still okay with it, of course. Because I absolutely wouldn’t blame you if you felt weird about this and, like...wanted to wait until I graduate or something."
    s "What would waiting that long change? "
    s "You’ll still be my niece’s best friend and I’ll still be a man who was supposed to be looking after you."
    s "This is wrong no matter what angle you look at it from."
    ay "I know."
    ay "But this is a mistake I’ve wanted to make for a very long time."
    ay "And I am also very horny right now."
    s "Sounds like a pretty normal day for you."
    ay "I am a girl in love in the throes of puberty and I will not allow you to shame me for my overactive imagination and desire to touch you."
    s "I’m not shaming you for anything. Nor am I trying to talk you out of it since I have no intention of refusing."
    ay "Then-"
    s "I just need you to promise that no one will ever find out about this."
    ay "..."
    s "Because, if they do-"
    ay "Sensei, I’m not an idiot. I may be blindly in love, but even a blind woman would be able to prevent herself from diving head first into a meat grinder."
    s "Please refrain from using the word “meatgrinder” while I am in the process of forming an erection."
    ay "I am about to sleep with my friend’s uncle...who is also my teacher...who is also nearly double my age."
    ay "I’m obviously going to keep that a secret."
    ay "When I say I love you, I don’t mean immature, schoolgirl love. I mean {i}real{/i} love. The kind that is protective and loyal and understanding."
    ay "I will do anything you ask me to, and {i}not{/i} because I’m worried that you’ll leave if I don’t-"
    ay "But because I want you to be happy."
    ay "I want us to be happy together."
    ay "But right now-"
    ay "More than anything-"
    ay "I want you to take me home and make love to me before I have an orgasm from just thinking about it."
    s "..."
    ay "..."
    s "Do we really need to go all the way back to the dorm?"
    ay "Sensei, when I said that I want my first time to be special, I didn’t mean “doggystyle on the roof” special. "
    s "I mean...there are other positions."
    ay "But my bed is so big and soft...and Sana is sleeping at her mom’s tonight."
    ay "And also, if we fall off the roof, there’s a good chance you could break your penis and never be able to have sex with me again."
    s "Dorm room it is."
    ay "Heheh...thank you."
    ay "Not just for agreeing to take me home...but for everything you’ve ever done since the moment we’ve met."
    ay "Tonight will be the start of something beautiful, Sensei."
    ay "I am forever yours...any way you want me."
    ay "Any way you-"
    s "Stop talking and start walking or I am going to wind up deflowering you on the stairs."
    ay "Deal. "

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "We make our way off of the roof and back into the school."
    "Ayane excitedly and hurriedly pulls me through the halls by the wrist, occasionally turning around and giggling."
    "It’s a childish giggle that fills me with a sense of lustful dread in both knowing and accepting that I am about to cross a boundary that I {i}know{/i} should not be crossed-"
    "And yet none of the horrible things that I have acknowledged both verbally and mentally even partially dissuade me."
    "This is who I am."
    "I am not built for love- but if I can help someone like Ayane {i}feel{/i} loved while gaining something for myself in return..."
    "I will help her time and time again."
    "And I will take her body in my hands, the same way she has dreamt of time and time again-"
    "And cocoon myself in the idea that I am only as broken as she thinks I am."

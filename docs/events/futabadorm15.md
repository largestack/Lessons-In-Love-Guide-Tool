    scene futabanewhj1
    with dissolve2

    "What happens between the time of the car door opening and the time of her unzipping my pants is all just a blur to me."
    "Somehow or another, I wind up on the bed. And somehow or another, she winds up beside it."
    "Rin isn’t home, so the slight chance at salvation or rescue from self-sacrifice that Futaba had slips down the drain quicker than vomit after a night of drinking."
    "While I don’t remember much of how we got here or why I simply just allowed it to happen after only a single question confirming her consent, I do remember the look in her eyes upon seeing it for the first time."
    "A mix between fear and an unquenchable desire to satisfy me spread through her eyes like a wildfire and I honed in on them like a helicopter dumping buckets of oil onto it instead of trying to put it out."
    "I stare into them again as she touches it for the first time, without even knowing what color I’m meant to call those eyes of hers."
    "Pinkish?"
    "Violet?"
    "Whatever color they are is beautiful- and the contrast is only increased by the thin layer of scleral fluid developing over them."
    "Will she cry? "
    "Do I {i}want{/i} her to cry?"
    "I don’t know. "
    "I don’t know anything at all."

    f "So...{i}this{/i} is what yours actually looks like."
    s "Different from your imagination?"

    scene futabanewhj2
    with dissolve

    f "It’s...a little on the bigger side, isn’t it?"
    f "Not like...I’ve really seen many apart from a few videos, but...I didn’t really expect to be able to...fit two hands around it."

    "Futaba has yet to actually {i}do{/i} anything to me, but the sight of a vulnerable girl sitting at the foot of her bed with my cock in her hands is already enough to excite me to the point of nearly bursting."
    "With each passing second of her eyes targeting mine, the fluid I noticed just moments ago begins to dry out."
    "Perhaps another part of her body required it."
    "Not that those fluids are one and the same- at least on a scientific level...but does that really make any amount of difference right now?"
    "Who cares if she cries? Who cares if she gets turned on? What truly matters is the way these hands will alleviate the numbness building up within me, present everywhere except the spot she focuses on."

    f "It...goes without saying, but...I really don’t know what I’m doing here, Sensei..."
    f "I knew this was coming soon enough, but...it’s not like I’ve researched what to do or anything..."
    f "So if I’m bad at it...I guess just...give me directions?"
    s "All you need to do is support me, Futaba."
    s "You figured it out earlier. {i}This{/i} is what needs to be done to help me feel better."
    f "Yeah...I’ll do my best."
    f "I’ll take good care of you."

    scene futabanewhj3
    with dissolve

    f "That’s all someone like me is good for, after all..."

    "It begins- the creeping of her fingers across the taut flesh of my shaft as if they are the legs of a dying spider."
    "They twitch and move in other strange ways, dancing like they have never attempted to dance before- and it’s the spontaneous and desperate movements that propel me closer to happiness."
    "This girl is good for more than just this. "
    "But if I were to tell her that, would she stop?"
    "Or would I find her whole self in my lap rather than the two small appendages I get to make use of tonight?"
    "She does what she can for several minutes, ignoring the hand I’ve placed on her head- stroking her hair as if to tell her that everything is going to be okay."
    "As if acknowledging that the rotten nature of what I’m having her do is something I’m somehow trying to cheer her up for."
    "It must be working since the fluid in her eyes has rejoined the air."

    scene futabanewhj4
    with dissolve

    f "Am I...doing okay?"
    f "Does that...feel good, Sensei?"
    f "Are you...starting to feel better?"

    "I don’t respond. "
    "Not because I don’t have anything to say, but because lying to her in this condition might destroy her self-esteem even more than undressing in a room full of smaller girls so often does to her."
    "She’s even more fragile than I am."
    "And yet she tugs at the skin of my cock, pulled tight by the pooling of blood, never once acknowledging that her hands could shatter at any moment and wind up as mere shards of martyrdom scattered across the bedroom floor."

    f "Should I go faster?...Slower?..."
    f "Harder?...Softer?..."
    f "Should I loosen my grip?...Tighten it?..."
    f "Or does your silence mean that I’m just...talking too much."
    s "Everything you’ve done so far is just fine, Futaba. "
    s "It’s more than enough just being able to spend time with you like this."
    f "You really mean that?..."
    f "I’m not just a...burden anymore?"

    "You never were."
    "But again, that admission remains unsaid. "

    scene futabanewhj5
    with dissolve

    "Futaba changes up her position when she notices dewy drops of precum beginning to leak out of me."
    "With her index finger, she explores the suspicious fluid, spreading it across the head of my cock before using it to lubricate the rest of me."
    "Despite this being her first time, she’s improving quickly."
    "I wonder if any of that has to do with the fact that she thinks I may leave her if she doesn’t."
    "I wonder if it’s due to the fact that she thinks this is all she’s good for."
    "And I wonder if it’s due to the fact that in what may be her most vulnerable state to date, I didn’t attempt to stop her."

    f "It’s...starting to get really hot, Sensei..."
    f "Are you close to finishing?"
    s "Not yet...You’re going to have to work a little harder."
    f "So...this stuff can start coming out before you’re about to...you know..."
    s "Before I’m about to what, Futaba?"

    scene futabanewhj6
    with dissolve

    f "Are you...going to make me say it out loud?..."
    f "Because it’s...kind of embarrassing and...I’m still not totally comfortable with things like this..."
    s "Well, you’ve made yourself pretty comfortable so far."
    f "That’s just...because I want you to feel good, Sensei..."
    f "I want to pay you back for all the extra time you’ve spent with me lately..."
    f "And I know that...even if I don’t really understand why...you think I’m pretty."
    f "So...since you think that way...it’s only natural that you’d get like this..."
    f "Which means it’s only natural for me...someone who’s watched you for a very long time...to help get those feelings out."
    s "..."
    f "..."

    scene futabanewhj5
    with dissolve

    "She goes back to fondling my cock, ignoring the abrupt end to a series of hastily exchanged admissions and misunderstandings."
    "Again, she spreads the result of my shortcomings as a man across me, painting me with my own guilt before making yet another mistake."

    scene futabanewhj7
    with dissolve

    f "Mm~"
    f "Chm...mnch...mmf..."

    "She tastes me and the first seeds of corruption are sown throughout her body."
    "It is only a matter of time now until they begin to grow."
    "Then, I will be able to pluck as many petals from her as I like."
    "A garden of lavender plants itself before me- one I will not be tempted to drop buckets of oil on, but buckets of water and fertilizer and anything else I can use to have her meet her final form quicker."

    s "Does it taste good?"

    scene futabanewhj8
    with dissolve

    f "It tastes like you."
    f "And maybe a little bit salty."
    f "I don’t hate it. But I’m not sure if it’s something I’d willingly seek out, if you know what I mean."
    f "Right now, though...I can’t imagine wanting anything else."

    scene futabanewhj9
    with dissolve

    "The seeds spread faster than I expect them to and, within a matter of moments, small green buds have begun to penetrate the soil that is this joining of flesh."
    "And while I wish I could admit to you that even throughout all of this I have felt nothing, I can’t."
    "I feel it all right now."
    "The heat of two small appendages."
    "The breath of a girl hiding her fear."
    "Even the air of this room, tainted as it may be from the pollution of this immoral act-"
    "I feel it all."
    "And I can’t even imagine a world in which I would stop this young, naive, vulnerable, desperate cocoon of a girl from jerking me off just inches away from her face."

    f "Hah...hah......ahh..."
    f "Mmf...Sensei...it’s getting...even harder...I...I can feel it..."

    "The uneasiness that I know still plagues her figures out a way to hide itself without needing to retreat halfway across town and blend in with the shadows."
    "Cracks form in her fragile hands as they clasp tighter around the idea that she can finally make my life a little more palatable. "
    "Her hot breaths fill in the cracks and create a never ending cycle in which she breaks and reforms, all while chipping away at my moral compass and inching me closer to a violent outpouring of hateful lust."
    "For a moment, once more, I think of her fingers as the legs of a spider."
    "And strangely enough, that moment brings me closer to releasing myself than I’d like to admit."

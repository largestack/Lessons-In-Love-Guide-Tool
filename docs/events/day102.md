    "He practiced speaking in the only way he could-"

        "Nozomu would fuck the fleshy object with his giant light-penis from dusk 'til dawn until he had no energy left in his body."

        "In fact, billions and billions of people were born between then and now."
        "Nozomu used his secret power to create humans, so he could fuck them instead of the fleshlight."
        "That’s when the humans learned that they could also fuck each other."
        "And so, in this new world where everyone fucked everyone else, some rules needed to be put in place."
        "And that’s when Nozomu stepped in once again."
        "So, in his strange light-voice he shouted to all of his children-"
        "{i}Thou shalt not fuck each other anymore!{/i}"
        "But language wasn’t invented yet, so no one understood him."
        "So Nozomu created language- and people understood him this time."
        "But they didn’t want to listen."
        "So they started making their own languages and writing their own rules of who it was okay to fuck and when."

        "Some people were perfectly happy with regular Pop-tarts."
        "But why didn't those people listen to Nozomu and just eat the new and improved ones?"

    if bonus == True:

        "And the only reason we’re here today is because God got bored of fucking the same fleshlight over and over again."
        "It’s a true story. Ask your history professor."
        "So, now that you know the origin of the universe, you’re free to believe pretty much whatever you want."

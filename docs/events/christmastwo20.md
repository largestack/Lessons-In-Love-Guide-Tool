    "I don’t make it up the stairs until the fireworks have stopped."
    "I heard them on the way up, but the only lights glued to the sky at this point are the ones that have been there for billions of years."
    "Which are, coincidentally, the same ones that have been gone for quite some time now due to the immense amount of distance those lights needed to travel for us to see them."
    "I’m sure their journeys were exciting."
    "The truth is that there are things that we can not see or understand until their time has already come and passed."
    "Whether it be stars-"
    "Or something else."
    "The most fantastic, amazing things are not without their own set of flaws. "
    "And that which seems invincible could already be gone."
    "It changes with the light or the angle."

    s "What are you doing?"
    m "Being cliche, I suppose."
    m "This is the part of the game where you make it to the rooftop to find the strange girl with her hand pointed up at the sky. "
    m "It’s a pretty standard trope that everyone just accepts because it seems wistful or...hopeful."
    m "Or any other adjective you’d be interested in throwing out to turn me into something other than a normal [teenage]girl."
    m "But there’s a reason for it. One that most people don’t know."
    m "A long time ago, before we had knowledge of the world above us, we’d use our hands to measure the distance between stars."
    m "It’s obviously not an accurate form of measurement, but it’s something that helps pass the time while you’re waiting for someone to show up."
    m "And I’m glad you showed up when you did, because my arm was beginning to get tired."
    s "Yeah...sorry for taking so long. I got caught up in something."
    m "It’s fine. If I had 100 yen for every time I’ve found myself stuck on rooftops waiting for you, I’d have..."
    m "Well, a lot of money."
    s "So..."
    s "I guess I have your phone number now."
    m "I guess you do."
    s "Are you still afraid of me annoying you? Or is that whole “I want to see you” thing from earlier the signal for us to start maybe closing the gap a little?"
    m "Saying I want to see you is much different from saying, “Hey, I enjoy your company and want to spend all of my free time with you.”"
    m "For all you know, I could have just wanted to tell you something."
    s "I think you’re a little smarter than saying something as blunt as “I want to see you” when there’s really a different reason for it."
    m "You can think whatever you want."
    m "That’s what makes life so...tolerable. Free thought. Free will."
    m "As free as you can be inside of a prison, of course. "
    m "But I suppose even long-term inmates revel in the idea of outdoor recreation."
    s "Do the others know you’re up here?"
    m "Probably."
    m "I’m the type of character that people normally just assume is on the roof if I’m nowhere to be seen."
    s "Ami and Ayane are probably going to assume we’re together then, won’t they?"
    m "Probably."
    m "Since you’re the type of character who always manages to find me."
    m "I suppose that's my fault this time around, though, seeing as I tipped you off and everything."
    s "You can put your arm down, Maya. The stars aren’t going anywhere."
    m "It’s hard to go anywhere when you’re stuck in a bubble."
    m "Also, I don’t need your permission to put my arm down. If I put my arm down, it will be because I want to put my arm down. Not because you told me to."
    s "You know, this isn’t a word I’d typically use to describe you, but you’re acting pretty sassy tonight."
    m "I’m in a bad mood. And feeling quite vulnerable, at that."
    m "It’s not much different from how you’ve been acting lately."
    s "Me?"
    m "I’m going to exercise my free will and put my arm down now."
    m "You’re welcome to sit next to me."

    m "I tried mentioning it yesterday, but...you’ve been acting a bit different lately."
    m "Like something happened to you that you’re trying to forget."
    m "And given how disgusting you are, I imagine that whatever it is must have been pretty bad."
    s "I didn’t realize you’d been paying so much attention to me."
    m "It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out when the world’s most monotonously mundane man has a shift in personality. It’s like noticing the transition from day to night."
    s "There’s a word for that transition and it’s called “afternoon.”"
    m "Delete my number. I already regret revealing it this early on."
    s "Hey, I thought that was decently funny."
    m "Comedy aside, do you have any interest in telling me what happened?"
    m "I’m absolutely horrible at cheering people up and likely can’t do anything for you but, whatever it is, I’m sure I’ve seen worse."
    s "I don’t know about that."
    m "I do."
    m "When you’ve lived as many {i}lives{/i} as me, you’ve kind of seen everything."
    m "Well...not {i}everything{/i} since there are still plenty of things happening that I don’t know how to approach or deal with-"
    m "But a lot of things."
    s "I hurt someone."
    m "All you ever do is hurt people. If my superpower is manipulating time, yours is destroying everything you touch."
    s "Wow, you really are bad at cheering people up."
    m "It’s one of my least favorite things in the world."
    m "Seeing you act so differently, though, has somehow been even worse."
    m "It’s like watching a baby slowly crawl toward the edge of a table. You know it’s about to fall off, but you just don’t want to do anything to stop it because you despise children."
    m "But, of course, you do it anyway- because it would be easier than explaining that you just watched as a child plunged to their potential demise."
    s "You should stick to star related metaphors. You’re better at them."
    m "And you should stick to feeling numb rather than beating yourself up all day. You’re better at it."
    s "I’ll get there. "
    s "Since we’re already sharing, what’s been eating you?"
    m "Time, the universe, and the sickening realization that my archetype is dissolving with each passing day."

    if bonus == True:
        s "Is this about that time you tried to have sex with me?"
    else:
        s "Is this about how you're still dead set on becoming the huggy girl?"

    m "Not specifically, but I’d certainly file it in the “related” cabinet."

    scene clearnightsky

    m "It’s strange."
    m "I’ve gone so long without feeling anything that I’d forgotten what it was like to fear. "
    m "It’s scary."
    s "Well...yeah. That’s kind of exactly what “fear” is."
    s "What are you afraid {i}of,{/i} though? Just how different everything is now that you don’t have some sort of loose timeline for it?"
    m "I think I’m more worried that the loose timeline you’re referring to might return."
    m "It’s getting to be that, well, {i}time{/i} again."
    s "The next reset?"
    m "Yes. Which, if my calculations are correct, should send us back into summer. "
    s "Good. I’m tired of the cold."
    m "You’ll tire of the heat much quicker."
    m "Or at least I hope you will."
    m "I don’t want you to disappear."
    s "That’s probably because you’re in love with me."

    scene remembertoevent3
    with fade

    m "That’s certainly a stunning accusation to just throw out there."
    s "Am I wrong?"
    m "Shouldn’t you be more concerned about the feelings of your long-lost childhood friend and world famous idol, Niki Nakayama?"
    s "..."
    m "Oh, come on. {i}Someone{/i} was obviously going to stumble upon you two with how loud and obnoxious she was being."
    m "You should feel lucky that it was me and not someone who’d go on to make a commotion out of it."
    m "Though, I will say that the idea of you standing me up to be with her is not one that I am very fond of."
    s "I take it your feelings for Niki are just as bad as your feelings for Noriko?"

    scene remembertoevent4
    with dissolve

    m "Not exactly."
    m "I want Noriko to fucking die. I don’t have any personal experience with her sister."
    m "Their relationship in itself is enough for me to dislike her, though."
    m "Of course, there’s also the fact that she could send you spiraling back into non-existence by bringing up “the good old days” too. I can’t say I’m very fond of that possibility either."
    s "Well, she’s certainly trying to bring back “the good old days.”"
    s "I’m starting to think that might not be a bad thing, though."

    scene remembertoevent5
    with dissolve

    m "What- disappearing doesn’t sound all that bad to you because, on the opposite side of things, you get to tongue wrestle an idol?"
    m "You should care more about trying to preserve your time here while you-"
    s "I remembered something tonight."

    scene remembertoevent6
    with dissolve2

    m "You...what?"
    s "Noriko decided to give me a box of letters that Niki wrote to me after I walked out on her."
    s "Then, the next thing I knew, it was like I was back in her old house."
    s "It was weird, though. It felt like less of a memory and more of me just...watching something that happened in the past."
    m "Well..."
    m "How do you know it was something that actually happened? It could have been another dream. You could have just...blacked out or-"
    s "I asked her about it and she confirmed it."
    s "So even if it doesn’t count as a normal memory, it’s still a thing from the past that actually happened. And even watching it happen wasn’t enough to “reset” me like you’re worried about."

    scene remembertoevent7
    with dissolve

    m "But...I don’t..."
    m "That shouldn’t be possible..."
    m "Every time I try to do literally anything, you short circuit. "
    m "Why the fuck are those two allowed to just mindlessly force you backwards but the second {i}I{/i} do it, it’s game over?"
    m "That doesn’t make any sense. It’s not supposed to work that way."
    s "I’m not going to pretend I know how anything works when you’ve been doing this a lot longer than me. I’m just telling you what happened."

    scene remembertoevent8
    with dissolve

    m "I...still think you should stay away from them whenever possible...this doesn’t seem right..."
    s "And that’s not just you being jealous?"
    m "If I was jealous, I would have done something about the two of you making out in the middle of the hotel walkway."
    s "You saw {i}that{/i} part too?"

    scene remembertoevent9
    with dissolve

    m "No. I made it up."
    m "Of course I saw it. I needed to see the baby fall off of the table even if I knew I was going to regret it later."
    m "But, again, I’ve seen worse."

    scene remembertoevent10
    with dissolve

    s "I kissed Miku, too. Were you there for that?"
    m "I {i}wasn’t{/i}. But if you’re just here to brag, I’ll save myself the annoyance and walk off the ledge of this roof right now."
    s "I’d be down to kiss a third person and keep the streak alive if you’re interested."
    m "You’re disgusting."
    s "Actually, thinking back on it, it was more like Miku kissed {i}me,{/i} but-"
    m "Is this something you think I’m interested in hearing? Because that ledge is starting to look very welcoming right now."

    scene remembertoevent11
    with dissolve

    s "You really {i}are{/i} in love with me, aren’t you?"
    m "No. You’re disgusting."
    s "Why don’t you just say it?"
    m "Because it’s not true."
    m "And even if it was, you wouldn’t be able to handle it."
    m "You’re free to call it a hunch or...choose to continue believing whatever weird circumstances allow the fucking Nakayamas to talk to you about the past and not {i}me{/i}, but..."
    m "I’m not going to risk saying something so big when this world is so small. It just...wouldn’t fit."
    s "..."
    m "..."
    s "There’s a euphemism to be made here."

    scene remembertoevent12
    with dissolve

    m "Uhh...no. There’s not."
    s "I’m sorry you’ve been feeling vulnerable and I’m sorry that I’m part of the cause of it."
    s "I’m also sorry that I didn’t get you a Christmas present either of the last two years."
    m "That’s three more apologies than I think I’ve ever gotten from you about anything."
    m "And, strangely enough, I don’t think any of them are warranted this time around."

    scene remembertoevent13
    with dissolve

    m "You don’t have to buy me presents or worry about how your actions will influence my mood. "
    m "Those sorts of things are far too childish for both of us."
    s "..."
    m "..."
    m "But..."
    m "There is {i}something{/i} you could do."

    scene remembertoevent14
    with dissolve

    s "And that is?"
    m "I doubt you remember since it hasn’t appeared to you in any sort of {i}cinematic vision,{/i} but my birthday is coming up soon."
    s "Is it your turn to break down over a plush bear? Because that thing was really cheap and has a 100%% success rate so far of making girls admit they like me."
    m "I don’t want a bear."
    m "I want you to spend the day with me."
    m "It’s the least you can do for making my life a living hell most of the time."
    s "So...to make up for annoying you all the time...you want me to be around you and annoy you even more?"

    scene remembertoevent15
    with dissolve

    m "And buy me food. That would be nice too."
    m "There’s a festival that night, so I’ll be sure to drain your wallet as best as I can."
    s "Sorry for asking, but what date is your birthday?"
    m "New Year's Day."
    m "Ironic, I know."
    s "I’ll go."
    s "I have a condition, though."
    m "I didn’t realize you were allowed to have conditions for a thing you should be doing out of the kindness of your heart."
    s "I probably shouldn’t, but I’m not the type to let a good opportunity slip through my fingers."
    m "You have made that very apparent. But please, proceed."

    scene remembertoevent16
    with dissolve

    s "You have to wear a yukata."
    m "That’s it? That’s your one condition?"
    s "I stand by my decision."
    m "I was going to do that anyway. Do you have any idea how attractive I am in traditional clothing? "
    s "Kind of, since I see you in the shrine maiden dress all the time."

    scene remembertoevent17

    m "Yeah...Yeah, you’ve always liked that one."
    s "...?"

    scene remembertoevent18

    m "Are you okay with that, though? It’ll be an entire day you have to spend away from your harem."
    m "What ever will Niki and Miku and Ayane and Noriko and Makoto and-"
    s "I get the point. I’m popular. "
    m "I’ll never understand why."
    s "I’m fine spending your birthday with you. I just didn’t really think that was a thing you’d want to do on account of {i}not{/i} being in love with me and your best friends thinking we’re a secret couple."

    scene remembertoevent19
    with dissolve

    m "That makes sense."
    m "Even I don’t know or understand what I want sometimes."
    m "But I deserve to be selfish every once in a while, and a birthday is a good opportunity for that."
    s "I guess it’s settled then."
    m "I guess it is."
    m "Oh, and one more thing."
    s "What’s that?"
    m "Merry Christmas, Sensei."

    s "I wouldn’t have it any other way."

    "We go downstairs separately, meeting back up with everyone at different times to dodge suspicion."
    "By the time we’re reunited, only Ami, Ayane, and Sana remain."

    "The five of us head back home, each one carrying some sort of gift."
    "For me, it’s two."
    "A box from Molly and a box from the past."

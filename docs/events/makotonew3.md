    s "Sorry, did you say something?"
    mak "I asked why you’ve just been standing there staring at me ever since you got here."
    mak "And...come to think of it, why are you here this late in the first place? I just closed the store."
    s "You closed the store and {i}didn’t{/i} immediately proceed to play with yourself? I am shocked."

    mak "That happened one time!"
    s "{i}That I know of.{/i}"
    mak "Yes, that {i}you know of.{/i} And I probably don’t have to remind you of this, but that worked out very well for {i}both{/i} of us."
    s "Exactly. Which is why I’m surprised you’re not repeating the process again tonight."

    scene makotonewthree10
    with dissolve

    mak "Well, I...may have been open to more...{i}experimentation{/i} if you showed up at a reasonable time..."
    mak "But it’s past midnight now and I have to be getting back to the dorm before Miku thinks I was..."
    mak "Well, before Miku thinks something bad happened to me."

    "Past midnight? How did that happen?"

    s "Don’t worry Makoto. You’re in good hands now that I’m here."

    scene makotonewthree11
    with dissolve

    mak "I am in {i}worse{/i} hands now that you’re here."
    s "Yeah, that’s fair."
    s "I’m not going to let you just walk back to the dorm on your own at this hour, though. I’ll come with you."
    mak "..."
    s "Makoto?"
    s "I’m trying to be nice and-"

    scene makotonewthree12
    with dissolve

    mak "Actually, how about we go somewhere {i}else{/i} instead?"
    s "Somewhere else? You literally just said you needed to be getting back home."
    mak "I did. But then I remembered the wonderful invention that is my cell phone and that my safety is all but a simple text message away."
    s "That doesn’t change the fact that it’s past midnight. I can’t imagine there’s anything open around here."
    mak "Around {i}here,{/i} no. But who says we have to stay here?"
    s "Is this the real Makoto Miyamura suggesting that we sneak around to different parts of town after midnight?"
    s "What, you jerk off your teacher {i}one{/i} time and you think you’re some sort of badass now?"

    scene makotonewthree13
    with dissolve

    mak "I never claimed to be a “badass.” In fact, I quite like staying out this late. Miku is the one who can’t stay awake past 11:00 PM."
    s "Strange. I didn’t really take you for a night owl."

    scene makotonewthree14
    with dissolve

    mak "Yes, well...I think there’s something rather peaceful about the night."
    mak "But I guess this is a weird time to say that as I’m about to suggest something that is the exact {i}opposite{/i} of peaceful."
    s "Loud, aggressive sex in a love hotel? Count me in."

    scene makotonewthree15
    with dissolve

    mak "More like a scenic walk through the urban district. The lights are beautiful this time of night."
    mak "Besides, I already gave you a chance to have sex with me and you said no."
    s "Honestly, I’d probably say no tonight as well. I was just being facetious."

    scene makotonewthree16
    with dissolve

    mak "What do you mean you’d say no? You were the one who essentially coerced me into a sexual relationship, weren’t you?"
    s "I didn’t do anything that you didn’t already want me to do."
    mak "But...if I wanted you to have sex with me-"
    s "I wouldn’t."
    mak "..."
    s "..."

    scene makotonewthree15
    with dissolve

    mak "Yeah, I don’t understand that at all and I think you’re lying."
    s "When have I ever lied to you before?"
    mak "Probably tonight, but I try to turn my brain off after work so I’m not going to bother deducing which statements were true and which ones were false."
    mak "{i}Instead,{/i} I am going to begin walking to the urban district. If only there was an adult to accompany me and make sure I don’t end up passed out in an alley somewhere along the way."
    s "I guess all I can do is just...be that adult then, huh?"
    mak "That’s right. All you can do is just be that adult."

    scene makotonewthree17
    with dissolve

    mak "I hope you don’t mind pulling an all-nighter, though, Sensei. I hear it gets harder the older you get."
    s "Wait, we’re going to be out all night?"
    mak "Is that a problem? We don’t have school tomorrow, so there’s nothing you need to worry about being late for."
    s "Nothing except sleeping, you mean. I can’t remember the last time I stayed out for the entire night."
    mak "Well, make sure you remember this time. It would hurt my feelings if you were to ever forget it."
    s "If I can stay awake through the whole thing, I promise to do just that."
    mak "And if you can’t?"
    s "Then..."
    s "I guess {i}I’ll{/i} be the one passed out in an alley somewhere."

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "I follow Makoto as she sets off down a street and at least {i}appears{/i} to know where she’s going."
    "I don’t really have any reason to be skeptical since, despite the differences in our age, she surely knows much more about the surrounding areas than I do..."
    "But I guess I’m a little skeptical nonetheless."
    "Not because I don’t trust her, but because I think that, somewhere in the back of my mind, I {i}want{/i} her to be wrong."
    "I just..."
    "Probably couldn’t tell you why if you wanted me to."
    "........."
    "......"
    "..."

    scene makotonewthree18
    with dissolve2

    "My ingrained desire for Makoto to be wrong about something, as unsurprising as it is, does not come to fruition."
    "We make it to the urban district in what seems like no time at all and spend a good half an hour or so wandering through the glow of neon and passing under billboards reminding us to smile."
    "I’d spit in their faces if I were fifty feet tall but, unfortunately, I’m stuck here on the ground as a slightly-above-average sized male."
    "Thankfully, being next to Makoto makes me feel much larger."
    "To be frank, being next to {i}most{/i} girls makes me feel much larger."
    "I’m just significantly more aware of that fact when I’m alone with them in the dark."

    mak "So, is there anywhere you’d like to go, Sensei? Dinner, perhaps?"
    s "Sure. Having a first date at 2:00 AM in an unfamiliar part of town will make a great story for the grandkids we’ll never have."
    mak "Okay, so {i}no{/i} dinner. I’m afraid I don’t have many more suggestions, though, if you’re not in the mood to eat."
    s "Just walking is fine. We don’t really need to do anything."
    mak "Are you saying you’re happy as long as you’re with me?"
    s "Do you actually think that’s something I would say?"
    mak "No, but that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t like to hear it."

    scene makotonewthree19
    with dissolve

    mak "Since we don’t have any plans, how about we go somewhere with a better vantage point?"
    mak "Coming here may have killed any chance we have for the quiet of the night to make its beauty apparent, but that doesn’t mean the sights need to die as well."
    mak "We can simply enjoy ourselves somewhere slightly closer to the sky."
    s "Sure. Wherever you want to go is fine."
    s "I’m getting tired of these billboards anyway."

    scene makotonewthree20
    with dissolve

    mak "What’s wrong? Not a fan of pop music?"
    s "..."
    s "I guess not."

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "We find our way to a staircase I can’t even see the top of."
    "And while some people might be consumed by curiosity at the sight of something like this, I just feel even more exhausted."
    "I’m tired."
    "I guess getting older really {i}does{/i} make staying awake throughout the night harder."
    "We begin to ascend and each and every step feels like walking on glass."
    "But somehow, Makoto manages to maintain a smile as her feet are cut open."
    "It’s admirable."
    "Not how she can be happy at a time like this-"
    "But how she can be so good at pretending nothing is wrong when everything is."

    scene makotonewthree21
    with dissolve2

    mak "Do you like heights, Sensei?"
    s "They...exist. I don’t really care one way or the other."
    mak "Well, {i}I{/i} love them."
    mak "I have since I was little."
    mak "I rode on my dad’s shoulders a lot when I was a baby, so I’ve got tons of memories of just...looking down on everything. Feeling like I’m flying."
    mak "Of course, I’m not a baby anymore and sitting on someone’s shoulders would barely constitute a “height” at all-"
    mak "But I guess that makes me appreciate places like this even more."
    mak "Or...any place where I can take in a lot at once."
    mak "The world is so big...and you and I are so small."
    s "And...you {i}like{/i} that? How insignificant we are in the grand scheme of things?"
    mak "Not really."
    mak "I just like the lights."
    s "I see..."

    "The night has reached a point where even here, in what I assume is the busiest place in all of Kumon-mi, has fallen silent apart from the distant music and scattered car alarms."
    "A gust of wind joins the fray every now and then- but even those are fleeting. The same way the occasional moments where Makoto’s eyes meet mine are."
    "We look away each time despite there not being a reason to."
    "I wouldn’t be surprised if there was still some evidence of my semen on her that persisted through a bath or shower or whatever method she uses to get herself clean."
    "But even with that in mind, we still look away."
    "I can’t tell if I like that or not."

    mak "Can I...ask a question that may or may not ruin the mood?"
    s "The only mood I have right now is “tired,” so you can go ahead and ask whatever you want."
    mak "Then..."
    mak "What are we?"
    s "What do you mean?"
    mak "I mean that up until recently, I always looked at us as mentor and apprentice. Or teacher and student. A whole bunch of things like that."
    mak "But it’s harder for me to view us as two separate entities now that we’re closer to becoming one."
    mak "So I just wanted to hear your thoughts on the matter."
    s "You’re you and I’m me. That’s all it is and that’s all it needs to be."
    mak "I figured you’d say something like that."
    s "Well, I’m sorry for being predictable."
    mak "You don’t have to apologize, Sensei. I wouldn’t have it any other way."
    mak "It’s not as if I imagined you’d come out and say we’re dating when, as nice as that sounds, it would be near-impossible to execute correctly."
    mak "Not to mention how many rules it would be breaking."
    mak "But..."
    mak "Maybe one day."
    s "I-"
    mak "Don’t talk. I don’t want you to ruin the life I’m imagining right now."
    s "..."
    mak "..."

    mak "Can I ask you one more thing, Sensei?"
    s "Oh, am I allowed to talk again?"
    mak "Just for this next question. After that, you can go back to being silent."
    s "Then ask away, I guess."
    mak "Sensei..."
    mak "Were you really serious when you said you wouldn’t have sex with me earlier?"
    s "..."

    "In fact, we don’t even last another hour."
    "Not wanting to walk all the way back, Makoto uses an app on her phone to call us a ride."
    "The car shows up within minutes and we wind up in our beds before the sun even starts to rise."
    "Makoto goes to sleep thinking about me."
    "Then I go to sleep thinking about someone else."

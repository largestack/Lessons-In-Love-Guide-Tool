    s "Yes. That exact principle is the single largest pillar in my teaching strategy."
    mak "I mean...it’s certainly not {i}not{/i} working?"
    c "Yeah. Weirdly enough, having someone like Sensei around is the exact motivation I needed to really start putting myself back on track."

    tb "She was quite resistant to the idea at first, actually. But she eventually came around after seeing how many people were flocking to this[school]."
    s "That’s great and all, but she could just move into the dorms instead. She doesn’t need a whole house."
    tb "Ooooooh, I see. I see."
    tb "But, what is a “dorm” exactly?"
    s "It’s like...an apartment specifically designed for people attending[school]."
    tb "My, that sounds like it would be absolutely splendid once she’s ready for it."
    tb "But I do think we should at least wait to see if she’s able to seamlessly transition into the actual[school] first before making a commitment like that."

    u "Man, just how many fluids am I going to get all over my clothes before the end of the day?"
    s "Don’t you think saying something like that might be a little too...{i}suggestive{/i} considering where we are right now?"

    u "What the heck is up with this cliche?!"
    u "Taking shelter from the rain in a love hotel?! Since when is this an anime?!"
    u "And just how crazy do they expect us to get?! There are like five hundred condoms on that bed! "
    s "That’s five hundred more than I’d ever intend to use, so..."

    scene utalovehotel4
    with dissolve

    u "Sensei..."
    s "What? Am I not allowed to dislike condoms?"
    u "Did you plan this? Were all of those buildings you tried going into before this one {i}actually{/i} locked? Or were you just holding out hope that we’d come across somewhere like this eventually?"
    s "You got me. I also summoned the rain with my magical, pervert powers. "
    u "I {i}knew{/i} it."
    s "Anyway, I guess we have to have sex now."

    scene utalovehotel5
    with dissolve

    u "No way, no way, no way! A love hotel for my first time?! That sounds like something Kirin would do!"
    s "No comment."
    u "I’m just not ready! Especially not with the guy my best friend likes!"
    s "But you’re already so wet."

    scene utalovehotel6
    with dissolve

    u "How do you know that?!"
    s "..."

    with dissolve

    u "Uhh..."
    u "Me too! "
    s "..."
    u "..."
    u "Sensei, all I can hear are other people getting it on. We’re going to have to keep talking or I’m at risk of being tainted forever."
    s "If you’re going to act so weird about taking shelter in a love hotel, how come you’re the one who paid for it?"

    scene utalovehotel8
    with dissolve

    u "Because you spent all of your money on me and couldn’t afford it! Also, I didn’t think they’d let me {i}actually{/i} pay! There’s no way I look old enough to check into a place like this!"
    s "If you keep yelling, you’re going to ruin the mood for all of the people who actually came here to, you know, have sex."

    scene utalovehotel9
    with dissolve

    u "That is seriously so many condoms."
    s "They’re probably trying to offload a massive stockpile that’s been around since before all the men were drafted."
    u "They want us to have sex with three year old condoms? There’s no way that’s up to code."
    s "If you go complain, we might be able to get some of my money back."

    scene utalovehotel10
    with dissolve

    u "{i}My{/i} money."
    s "We all know whose money it really is."

    scene utalovehotel11
    with dissolve

    u "Hah...No, it’s fine. "
    u "I’m soaking wet and cold and don’t wanna bother going back out into the lobby since they might try to card me."
    u "I have no idea how I’d even {i}start{/i} explaining that to my parents."
    s "I bet you’re feeling like a real idiot for leaving your other clothes behind now, aren’t you?"

    scene utalovehotel12
    with dissolve

    u "You know, Sensei, I’m pretty sure there are rules against inviting a girl to a love hotel if you’re just going to poke fun at her the entire time."
    s "Sure. Except I didn’t actually {i}invite{/i} you. So technically I can do whatever I want so long as I’m not breaking any laws."

    scene utalovehotel13
    with dissolve

    u "Yeah, I think it may be a little too late for that."
    u "You wouldn’t happen to have any spare clothes in those oversized man-pockets of yours, would you?"
    s "I would not. But if we’re both cold, I heard something about-"
    u "If you seriously suggest getting naked and sharing body heat right now I’m going to death beam you. "
    s "There’s...a {i}death{/i} beam now?"
    u "I have tons of beams for tons of occasions. I’ve just only showed you the flavor one so far."
    s "There’s no “heat beam” or “drying beam” is there?"
    u "I haven’t yet mastered those, unfortunately."
    s "What are we supposed to do then? Just stand here, not having sex, and freezing our asses off?"

    scene utalovehotel14
    with dissolve

    u "I mean...there {i}is{/i} a bathtub. And it looks like there’s a shower too. The only issue is that the glass is see through and...yeah."
    s "Do you...want to shower together?"

    scene utalovehotel15
    with dissolve

    u "What?! Absolutely not! I was just saying that if {i}you{/i} want to take a bath or something, I can just close my eyes or...watch videos on my phone until you’re done."
    u "At least that way you wouldn’t be cold anymore."
    s "I feel like this is the part where I’m supposed to be a gentleman and insist that you go first but, honestly, that sounds good and I’m probably going to take you up on it."

    scene utalovehotel13
    with dissolve

    u "Don’t you think you might be a little {i}too{/i} carefree sometimes, Sensei? "
    s "That means nothing from a girl who spent her hard earned money getting the two of us a room in a love hotel."
    u "Make up your gosh darn mind about whose money it is already. "
    s "Fine. It’s mine. Now, give the rest of it back or I’m going to go see if the couple next door wants to come and join us for a foursome."
    u "That’s a whole lot of people and not a lot of Uta."
    s "Don’t worry. I wouldn’t be open to sharing you anyway."
    u "So you can take, but you won’t give. I see how it is."

    scene utalovehotel16
    with dissolve

    u "I’ll tell you what...tonight’s {i}clearly{/i} been a slog for both of us, so..."
    u "How ‘bout you get into that bathroom..."
    u "Take off all of your clothes..."
    u "And let me swap places with Uta-chan one more time so she can provide a little...{i}special{/i} service to make your night {i}that{/i} much better..."
    s "That sounds great. Now tell me how this “special service” is going to differ from what I want it to be."
    u "Well, I can’t just tell you while you still have all of your clothes on, Master."
    s "I really wish I could bring myself to believe that there is any hope for sexual gratification in those words, but I just really can’t at this point."
    u "Why not?"
    s "Because you have broken me."
    u "Then I guess I’ll just have to be {i}really{/i} gentle when I’m putting you back together, won’t I?"
    s "..."
    u "..."
    s "God damn it."

    scene utalovehotel17
    with dissolve

    u "Don’t forget to make sure all of the surfaces are properly wiped down first! This is a sketchy hotel and it would be a real shame if Uta-chan were to be sullied by {i}another{/i} surprise fluid tonight!"
    s "Keep talking and I’ll give you all of the “surprise fluid” you’ll ever need."

    scene utalovehotel18
    with dissolve

    u "{i}Oh my God...what am I doing?{/i}"
    s "Are you sure you don’t want to just take a bath together? You-"

    scene utalovehotel19
    with dissolve

    u "Yup! "
    u "And I know that saying this will probably have the reverse effect, but please don’t look over here for the next thirty seconds! I have to do something really quick!"

    play sound "water1.mp3"

    "I fill the bath with water, making sure its warm before stripping down and getting inside."
    "I also defy all expectations and don’t look Uta’s way for the full thirty seconds I promised to abstain for."
    "At second thirty-one, though, you can bet your ass that’s exactly where I looked."
    "Unfortunately, by then, she was finished with whatever she needed to do...and so I turn my gaze back to the water as she makes her way across the room and over to me."

    u "So...are you ready for your {i}special service,{/i} Master?"
    s "Ready to be disappointed, you mean? Yes."
    u "Don’t get testy with me. Do you have any idea how many people would kill for what you’re about to experience?"
    u "Up until now, I’ve only done this for my family. "
    s "Okay, well that just means my opinion of you is going to change dramatically if this actually does wind up being sexual."
    u "Master, please. If it’s incest you’re looking for, you’re going to need to come back during the morning shift and ask for the one with twintails. She’ll have what you need for sure."

    scene utalovehotel20
    with dissolve2
    play sound "water1.mp3"

    s "Wow, what a surprise. Something completely G-rated."
    u "Oh, hush. You know you’re enjoying this."
    u "Besides, you should be happy since the last person I did this for died of brain cancer and you’re still alive and kicking."
    s "Yeah, that makes me feel great."
    u "On a serious note, though...just relax, Master. Let your worries wash away. "
    u "It must be so nice finally being out of the cold, huh? Can you feel your body warming back up?"
    s "Yeah. But it does feel a little bad knowing that you’re still soaking wet when you should be in my place right now."

    scene utalovehotel21
    with dissolve

    u "Yeah, uhh..."
    u "Probably not a good idea for me to take my clothes off in here."
    s "Do you not trust me?"
    u "Uhhhh..."
    u "{i}I...do...{/i}"
    u "But whether or not I trust you isn’t really the problem."
    s "What is the problem then?"

    scene utalovehotel22
    with dissolve

    u "Can’t say this sounds like letting your troubles wash away, Master."
    s "Just “Sensei” is fine right now. I like being called “Master” and all, but I’d like for this to be a memory between Uta and me. Not Uta-{i}chan{/i} and me."

    scene utalovehotel23
    with dissolve

    u "(Screaming internally and also horny)"
    s "Is there a problem?"
    u "....{i}Nope!{/i} Just a cramp in my arm! Don’t mind me!"
    s "Anyway, if you’re not going to get in with me, you should probably dry yourself off. There’s no way it’s comfortable being in those clothes right now."

    scene utalovehotel24
    with dissolve

    u "It’s no biggie. I used to play in the rain a lot when I was little, so feeling like this is actually a big ole’ nostalgia trip for me right now."
    u "It’s really only my underwear and socks that bother me when they’re wet and I already took those off like a minute ago."

    scene utalovehotel25
    with dissolve

    s "Is that what you were doing when you made me look away?"
    u "What’s this? You actually {i}looked away?{/i} Who knows when the next chance you’ll get to see me in that state is, Sensei?"
    s "I’m sure the day will come. I’m surprised you’re just...okay with talking about that, though."
    u "Why? Are you getting excited?"
    s "Would you join me if I was?"
    u "I’d have to make a phone call first."

    scene utalovehotel26
    with dissolve

    s "If that is what must be done, so be it. Just maybe don’t mention my age. Or my job. Or even my appearance as I don’t want your parents trying to track me down."
    u "I’m not telling anybody anything, Sensei. Don’t you worry."
    u "What matters now is enjoying our time here before the rain stops."
    u "This is all just one more cliche we’ll scratch into our memory books. And when we look back on it years from now, if you’re still putting up with me then, I’m sure we’ll laugh."

    scene utalovehotel27
    with dissolve

    u "Unless you and Io really {i}do{/i} run away, that is. Which you shouldn’t, because losing both of you at once would make it hard for even me to keep on smiling."
    s "Maybe I will? I bet {i}Io{/i} would get in the bath with me."

    scene utalovehotel28
    with dissolve

    u "PFFFT! HAHAHAHA! HAHAHA!"
    s "...Did I say something funny?"

    scene utalovehotel29
    with dissolve

    u "Oh, no! No no no! I shouldn’t have laughed there! I’m sorry! It wasn’t funny. "
    u "That just...it took me by surprise, that’s all. I wasn’t like...doubting you or anything."

    scene utalovehotel30
    with dissolve

    u "I, uhh...{i}would{/i} like to hear why you think that, though."
    u "Unless it’s something you don’t want to talk about. Which, if it is, we can go back to being silent and listening to all of the other couples have sex."

    scene utalovehotel31
    with dissolve

    u "Oh! And when I say “other” couples, I’m not implying that {i}we’re{/i} a couple. No way. We’re just two people stuck inside a room full of condoms, trying to keep each other comfortable without using any!"
    u "Classic Uta-Sensei relationship, right?!"
    s "..."
    u "..."
    u "Please talk. You’re making me feel like I made a huge mistake just now."
    s "I just think you’re acting a little weird, that’s all."

    scene utalovehotel32
    with dissolve

    u "Well...just..."
    u "What makes you think Io would do something like that?"
    u "You...know you can like somebody without wanting to get in their pants, right?"
    s "But that’s the best part."

    scene utalovehotel33
    with dissolve

    u "Not everybody’s like that, Sensei. Some people just want somebody they can be close to or...somebody they don’t get bored of. "
    u "I’m sure there are plenty of girls in the class, cough cough Ami, who’d be happy to jump your bones, but you’re smarter than expecting {i}everybody{/i} to just be on board right away, aren’t you?"
    s "Of course I am. For example, I know {i}you’re{/i} in no rush to “jump my bones,” which is why I’m able to constantly joke about it the way I do."
    u "Hahah...yeah...funny jokes..."

    scene utalovehotel34
    with dissolve

    s "I can’t accurately judge everyone, though. So if you know something I don’t know and are at liberty to share it, I implore you to do so."
    u "Those are dangerous words to say to a girl who’s notoriously bad with secrets, Sensei."

    scene utalovehotel35
    with dissolve

    u "But...umm...for your sake...and because we need more stuff to talk about so all of those couples in the other rooms don’t start makin’ me feel some kind of way..."
    u "I just..."
    u "Well, I wouldn’t get my hopes up if I were you. Least not until you know for sure."
    u "Last thing you wanna do is make a move too early and scare somebody off, you know."
    s "How early is too early?"
    u "That..."

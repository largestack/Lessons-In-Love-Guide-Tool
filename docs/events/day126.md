    "Yumi is in the classroom today. "
    "This is truly an event that will go on to shock the world."
    "Of course, such a rare occurrence doesn’t come without its setbacks, though."
    "For example, Futaba isn’t even here yet and her seat has already been stolen. "
    "I mean, it’s not like we have assigned seating in this classroom or anything like that, but it’s still clear that this is a targeted act on Yumi’s behalf."
    "To be honest, I’m surprised she even remembers where Futaba sits with how little she comes to class."

    y "Just fucking say it, fatass. The hell do you want?"

    scene yumidesk3
    with dissolve

    f "Can you...at least let me get my books out of the desk?"
    y "Depends. Anything in it for me?"
    f "What...would you want?"
    y "Hmm...have any cash on ya? I’d probably be willing to sit somewhere else if you can spot me some lunch money."

    scene yumidesk4
    with dissolve

    f "Is there anything else you would want? I don’t really have enough money on me to buy lunch for both you and myself."
    y "That’s fine. You’ve got enough food stored in you to go without lunch for a day or two. Maybe even a week, now that I think about it."

    "Hearing that, I begin to make my way over to their side of the room and prepare myself to intervene if things escalate any further."
    "Technically, Yumi isn’t doing anything {i}wrong{/i} other than just being a bitch, so I should wait to see if anything else actually happens."


    f "But...I already skipped breakfast today and-"
    y "And what? You’re not thinking of eating any of {i}us{/i}, are you?"
    y "Lay a finger on me and I’ll fucking murder you. "

    scene yumidesk5
    with dissolve

    f "I wouldn’t ever do something like that to you...or {i}anyone{/i}. I just want my books..."
    y "Yeah, I heard you the first time. Do I need to repeat my demands or are you going to fork over a few hundred yen?"
    s "How about I buy you lunch instead, Yumi? Will that work?"

    scene yumidesk6
    with dissolve

    "I decide to step in before I become an accomplice to extortion, which I’m pretty sure is against[school] policy."
    "I haven’t even bothered trying to read the handbook, though. So who even knows?"

    y "The fuck are you doing here?"
    s "I know you’re not here often, but you {i}are{/i} aware this is my classroom, correct?"
    y "I guess. And {i}you{/i} are aware that I can do whatever the fuck I want, correct?"
    s "That’s true outside of[school] grounds, but I’m pretty sure I’m obligated to step in during situations like this."
    f "Um...Sensei...you don’t have to-"
    s "It’s okay, Futaba."
    s "I think I've learned how to deal with her by now."

    scene yumidesk7
    with dissolve

    y "The fuck do you mean you've {i}learned how to deal{/i} with me? Why are you makin’ it sound like some fuckin’ chore?"
    y "Last I remember, you were the one stalking {i}me{/i}. Isn’t that right, asshole?"

    scene yumidesk8
    with dissolve

    f "S-Stalking?...Is that...true?"

    scene yumidesk9
    with dissolve

    y "Fuck yeah it’s true. And that’s just the beginning of it."

    else:
        y "He makes me juggle, too. Fucking asshole."
        f "J-J-Juggle?!"

    s "Okay, calm down. I’m not stalking anyone."
    s "I’ve just been trying to help Yumi out from time to time."

    scene yumidesk8
    with dissolve

    y "Uhh, dipshit, I’ve been telling you for pretty much forever that the best way to ‘help me out’ is by just leaving me the fuck alone."
    y "If you wanna pay for my lunch, cool, but I’m not givin’ up the fuckin’ desk. I was here first. I know my rights."

    "I sigh to myself and direct my attention to Futaba."

    s "She does have a point, Futaba. You’re all technically allowed to sit wherever you want. And Yumi {i}was{/i} here first today."

    scene yumidesk10
    with dissolve

    y "Wait...are you actually takin’ my side? The fuck is goin’ on here?"
    s "I’m not taking anyone’s side. I’m just saying you’re allowed to sit wherever you want. "
    s "But, if at all possible, do you think you’d be able to reach deep inside that shell of a heart you have and find the kindness to give Futaba her books?"
    s "She’s not bothering you."
    y "I don’t know, man. Feels pretty bothersome to have to get off the desk just so some fatass can read books about knights and giant lizards and shit."

    scene yumidesk11
    with dissolve

    f "They’re...dragons...not lizards."
    y "I don’t give a fuck what they are. They’re weird as shit and you’re weird for reading them."
    s "Yumi, I know doing this doesn’t really work on you, but I’m going to have to give you detention if you insult Futaba again."

    scene yumidesk12
    with dissolve

    y "Are you now?"

    "Yumi hits me with an ice-cold gaze that would be more than enough to freeze the heart of anyone not used to her."
    "But, seeing as I’ve legitimately made out with her without any consequences, I’m beginning to think she’s more bark than bite."

    s "I am. In fact, you’re banned from cursing for the rest of the day."

    scene yumidesk13
    with dissolve

    y "Suck my dick you fucking ass-weasel!"
    s "Okay, first off, where do you get these insults?"
    s "Second, you have detention now. You’re staying after class today."
    y "I ain’t doin’ shit! I’ll leave this fuckin’ place right now!"

    scene yumidesk15
    with dissolve

    f "Umm, Sensei? I’m sorry for causing so much trouble. If I knew this was going to happen, I wouldn’t have ever asked for my books in the first place."
    s "Don’t blame yourself just because Yumi has self-control issues, Futaba."
    y "{i}I{/i} have self-control issues? Oh, that’s real fuckin’ rich."
    y "Bravo to you, dude. Completely ignoring your own problems and just pawnin’ all of your bullshit off on me. Thanks a lot for that."
    s "…"

    scene yumidesk16
    with dissolve

    f "…"
    f "Um...what does she mean by that, Sensei?"
    y "Yeah, {i}Sensei{/i}. Go on and tell her and see if {i}I’m{/i} still the bad guy."
    s "Don’t worry about it, Futaba. Yumi’s talking about something that happened between the two of us outside of[school]."
    f "Outside of[school]?..."
    s "It doesn’t concern you. But, Yumi-"
    y "What now? Gonna fuckin’ {i}suspend{/i} me instead?"
    s "No. But I think the two of us need to have another talk."
    y "…"
    y "Yeah, and I think the two of {i}you{/i} can both go fuck yourselves."
    y "I’m outta here."
    y "Peace."

    "Yumi quickly hops off of the desk and makes her way out of the classroom, leaving Futaba and me in the dust."

    f "…"
    s "…"
    f "I’m...a little confused...about what that was all about..."

    "I’m not. I was beginning to think that Yumi had gotten over that...occurrence from a while ago, but it’s clear to me now that this is most certainly not the case."
    "I’ll have to talk to her about that soon..."
    "But for now, I’ve got to do everything I can to revert the situation back to normal."
    "I clear my throat and prepare to drag Futaba back to “reality.”"

    s "Well, on the bright side-"
    s "At least you got your desk back."

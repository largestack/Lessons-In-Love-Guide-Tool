    ya "You...want to know about the tendrils of the sky?"
    no "I’d like to know anything and everything. {i}Knowing{/i} is kind of what I do."
    s "What a surprise. Knowing is what Yasu does as well. Maybe you’d like to lend her your arm so she can get off of mine?"
    no "I’m happy to lend my arm to just about anybody."
    s "Could’ve fooled me."
    no "Ha. Funny."
    ya "The tightness in my chest tells me that I should not switch arms...and that any arm apart from this one has the potential to infect me with feelings I do not deserve to feel."
    no "Are you certain that’s what the {i}tightness{/i} is telling you? Because, based on my experience-"
    s "So anyway, tendrils."

    scene stillcalm2

    ya "Right! It is my duty to be the font of information undocumented, so I will tell you all about the opening of the sky and the tendrils that extend beyond man’s wildest imagination."
    ya "There is only one god. A god of infinite eyes. But there are forces in this world that would have people believe otherwise."
    ya "Forces of great power, but poor intent. And often times, these powers are used to both intimidate and scare those who walk His holy grounds."
    ya "The tendrils of the sky are one of many examples of this. And while their tangibility is not the same as if you were to reach out and touch me, the impact they would have on you would be much greater."
    ya "Your mind would turn to dust. Your organs to ash. And all of your thoughts congealed into a twisting mass of ivy that feeds into the dirt and goes on to stretch from building to building."
    no "So...the sky would have us returned to the ground?"

    scene stillcalm3
    with dissolve

    ya "You hear my words, but misjudge their meaning. This world is not as simple as one above and one below."
    ya "It is an endless labyrinth of layers invisible to the naked eye...each with its own steady stream of waste."
    ya "They all flow into one pool that we are forced to bathe in. "
    ya "The dirty runoff is collected and returned to the sky."
    ya "And so the ground mixes with the air...and rains down upon the ivy, cannibalizing itself as it recycles energy and becomes stronger in a way much more difficult than simply asking Him for power."
    ya "We all become water. We all become dirt. It is the cycle of everything that is and everything that wants to be. And only He can pull us from the vines and save us from this never ending circling of the drain."
    s "I couldn’t have said it better myself."
    no "Interesting."
    no "Why haven’t I heard of this...fascinating religion before?"

    scene stillcalm4
    with dissolve

    ya "Because I am the only one who speaks of it! Are you interested? Do you seek salvation? For if you do, I can show you the light. "
    ya "And before you know it, you will be bathing in its warmth rather than a puddle of human excrement."
    no "I think I’ll stick to bathhouses and showers. But I thank you for taking the time to explain a bit about your religion to me. I won’t lie in saying I’ve been very curious since the moment you walked in."
    f "I...was worried you were going to say something mean to her."

    scene stillcalm5
    with dissolve

    no "You were? Why?"
    f "Well...you’ve always been very quick to debate people when it comes to religion."
    no "Futaba, as an atheist, I am obligated to do just that. But there is a certain fundamental basis to what Yasu preaches that I see no reason to speak out against."
    no "She speaks of a cycle. And while it is essentially just a rehashed and painted version of the {i}water{/i} cycle, it’s not as if she’s telling us about stone tablets that dictate the way we live our lives..."
    s "She did talk about giant invisible sky tentacles, though."

    scene stillcalm6
    with dissolve

    no "And I hope she is right about them for that is the single most enticing thing I have ever heard about any religion."
    s "Just wait until you learn what my supposed duty would be if I were a devout follower."
    no "Oh? Would you care to educate me?"
    s "I don’t want to say it in front of Futaba. She’s still too pure."

    f "I...I am?! "
    f "Still? "
    f "I would have figured that...you know..."
    no "Yes, Futaba...share the juicy details of what whisked away your purity out loud. Loud enough for the whole class to hear. "
    s "Or don’t. "
    s "In fact, definitely don’t. It’s been over five minutes and I have officially overstayed my welcome."

    scene black

    no "What welcome? You know you’re welcome here any time, Sensei."
    s "I am honoring Yasu’s premonition and only sticking around for a little while today. After that, you’re all on your own. Or...at least under Imani’s supervision."
    s "That said, Yasu- back to your seat."
    ya "Okay. Thank you for being with me, Sensei. I was entirely unworthy of your protection, yet received it anyway."
    ya "I can hardly even hear any whispers about the bad thing anymore."
    s "That’s great news. Anyway, goodbye everyone. It’s been-"
    no "Wait one second, Sensei. Don’t you think {i}I{/i} need a little protection too? It’s not fair if only Yasu gets some, is it?"
    f "What would you need protection for? "
    f "You haven't been groping Makoto again, have you?"
    s "Okay, I’m suddenly interested in staying."

    "I follow Nodoka and Futaba over to their seats on the side of the room, both surprised and {i}un{/i}surprised to hear about Nodoka’s {i}second{/i} sexual violation over the last 24 hours."
    "The two of them pick up exactly where they left off before I wandered into class late and proceed with the conversation as if I’m not extremely turned on by the thought of it."

    no "I’ll try to keep this short seeing as Sensei is likely extremely turned on by the thought of it-"

    "Yeah, I should have seen that coming."

    no "But yes. I {i}have{/i} been groping Makoto again and it has been very fun for both of us."
    s "It has?"
    f "I...don’t think it has. I’m pretty sure Makoto isn’t bisexual."
    no "You don’t need to be bisexual in order to enjoy the sensation of the sex you’re not interested in exploring your body."
    f "I’m pretty sure...that’s exactly what you need to be bisexual for."
    no "Well, either way, Makoto isn’t the type to put a hit out on me over something as trivial as a little bit of dubiously consensual rubbing."

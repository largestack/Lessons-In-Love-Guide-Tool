    scene dayonefourtwo18
    with dissolve

    a "Code language. Instead of saying beach trip, I said ‘educational field trip.’"

    "Oh. Well, I guess that is at least mildly smart. I’m surprised everyone else was able to catch on so easily, though."
    "But, then again, I’m sure that by now, they wouldn’t ever expect me to take them on a trip with any amount of educational value, so it’s all starting to make sense."

    a "So yeah, just tell everybody how big the place is gonna be and-"
    s "Ami, I haven’t even booked the place yet. I don’t even know if I’ll be able to find one."

    f "It’s not very large, but I think we should be able to fit everyone in two or three rooms."
    f "Some of us will likely have to sleep on the ground, but...I think it can work."

    r "Well, umm..."

    s "Of course."

    "To be fair, it’s kind of hard to forget after I saw her in that delirious state a while back."

    r "Well, being somewhere I’m not used to normally freaks me out a bit. I think it’s an anxiety thing."
    r "And it’s not like I’m gonna bail on the trip or anything like that. I think it sounds fun."
    r "But if I start acting all...you know...weird..."

    scene dayonefourtwo31

    s "Even Chika?"

    scene dayonefourtwo35
    with dissolve

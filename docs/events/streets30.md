    "{i}There is a place where the sidewalk ends{/i}"
    "{i}And before the street begins,{/i}"
    "{i}And there the grass grows soft and white,{/i}"
    "{i}And there the sun burns crimson bright,{/i}"
    "{i}And there the moon-bird rests from his flight{/i}"
    "{i}To cool in the peppermint wind{/i}"

    s "…"

    "These are the words of Shel Silverstein, acclaimed children’s writer and poet."
    "Let us think for a moment."
    "What if, by some stretch of the imagination, there {i}was{/i} a place where the sidewalk ended?"
    "And, for the sake of the argument, let’s say the street ended there too."
    "What do you think would happen if you were to just walk off the edge?"
    "How long would you fall for?"
    "Would it be for the rest of eternity?"
    "Or would there be somewhere at the bottom where you could land?"
    "I’ve heard stories in the past about how people falling from buildings tend to die before ever hitting the ground."
    "Or at least they faint or something along those lines."
    "But, for anyone insane enough to stare death in the eyes and say “Sure, take me if you want-”"
    "I wonder what that collision with the ground would feel like."
    "I can’t imagine it would be very good."
    "If for some reason, though, you managed to survive the impact and a friendly passerby helped push your bones back into your body-"
    "What is it that you’d want to see there?"
    "This entire scenario is hypothetical, so it could really be anything you’d wish for."
    "I mean, you {i}did{/i} walk off the edge after all. "
    "So there must be {i}something{/i} you were hoping to achieve or...find."
    "Or feel."
    "Now, I’m not saying Shel Silverstein’s works are meant to convince children that it’s okay to jump to their deaths. "
    "It’s not."
    "But poetry is something where we’re meant to interpret our own meanings and come to our own conclusions."
    "Oh, and the very next line of that poem is “Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black.”"
    "So, yeah. "
    "Anyway, the sidewalk probably does end somewhere. "
    "The street, too."
    "But the likelihood of there being anything beneath it-"
    "A place where your legs could shoot through your upper body if you landed at the perfect angle-"
    "The likelihood of something like that simply does not exist."
    "But you do."
    "Or do you?"
    "And if you don’t-"

    y "What the absolute fuck are you doing right now?"

    scene wherethesidewalkends2
    with dissolve

    s "Oh, Yumi. Hey."
    y "The fuck do you mean, “Oh, Yumi, Hey?”"
    y "I’ve been watching you just...standing there staring into a tunnel for like five minutes now."
    y "You on drugs or something?"
    s "Not that I’m aware of."
    s "I’m not the only one acting out of character, though."

    scene wherethesidewalkends3
    with dissolve

    y "The fuck is that supposed to mean?"
    s "I don’t know."
    s "It might sound a little weird, but I never really pictured you as the type to buy ice cream."

    scene wherethesidewalkends4
    with dissolve

    y "What kind of fucking person do you think I am?! Everyone likes ice cream!"
    s "Can you even afford it?"

    scene wherethesidewalkends5
    with dissolve

    y "You know what? Just go back to standing in the middle of the street. "
    y "If you get hit by a car, though-"
    s "You shouldn’t talk about people being hit by cars."
    y "And you shouldn’t make fun of girls for being poor and eating ice cream, asshole."
    s "You’re right. I humbly apologize."
    s "Yumi, please allow me to purchase you a frozen dessert."

    scene wherethesidewalkends6
    with dissolve

    y "Alternative option- how about you leave me alone?"
    s "You’re the one who called out to me, remember? You could have just let me stand there."
    y "You’re right. I could have."
    s "So why didn’t you?"
    y "Beats me. I’m probably just getting used to seeing you wandering around like you’re in a fuckin’ trance or something."
    y "You know my mom now, right? That alone increases your chances of becoming a junkie by like...fifty."

    "Now that she mentions it, Yumi {i}does{/i} seem to be around pretty frequently during whatever those...momentary lapses of judgement I have are."
    "I look back to where the sidewalk ends to find that it doesn’t end at all."
    "It’s just as she said- a tunnel."
    "So then why did I see it as something so much different?"

    s "…"
    y "What? Now you’re gonna get all quiet?"
    y "Forget I said anything. Just go and fucking-"
    s "Yumi, do you have any supernatural powers?"
    s "Like changing people’s perception of things or...resetting the world?"
    y "…"
    s "…"

    scene wherethesidewalkends7
    with dissolve

    y "Fuck you."
    s "Interesting. That’s not a “no.”"

    scene wherethesidewalkends8
    with dissolve

    y "It fucking {i}is{/i} a no! Of course I don’t have magical powers! I’m not fuckin’ Sailor Moon or some shit!"
    s "Then stop showing up whenever my brain starts short circuiting."
    y "Get a new fucking brain! The one you have sucks anyway!"
    y "Also, aren’t {i}you{/i} the one who decided to come here?!"
    y "You know I wander around during the afternoons and it {i}definitely{/i} doesn’t look like you’re going anywhere important right now."
    s "Huh. Actually, I think you’re right."
    s "I was hoping to find you today."

    scene wherethesidewalkends9
    with dissolve

    y "Wow. Shocker. When has that ever happened before?"
    y "So...what do you want?"
    y "You found me. I’m not running away. What do you want?"
    s "Just to hang out I guess."

    scene wherethesidewalkends10
    with dissolve

    y "Why? Aren’t you supposed to be at a fucking hot spring with Chika right now or something?"
    s "She told you about that?"
    y "Of course she fucking told me about that. We live together. "
    y "She never fucking shuts up about you. It’s going to drive me insane one of these days."
    y "Also, can I buy my fucking ice cream already? I didn’t realize you were going to take this long to finish whatever you’re trying to say."
    s "Sure."
    s "Are you sure you can afford it, though?"

    scene wherethesidewalkends4
    with hpunch

    y "Yes! I can fucking afford 200 yen for ice cream!"

    "Yumi presses a button on the machine, leaving the two of us to wait in suspense/silence for the roughly ten seconds it takes for the claw to work its magic."
    "The ice cream jumps to its death."
    "She peels the wrapper off and tosses it into a trash can. "
    "I feel like if this were several months ago, she would have intentionally gone out of her way to drop it on the ground {i}beside{/i} the trash can."
    "That could just be me not giving her enough credit."
    "But I would like to attribute her newfound instinct to throw away garbage to myself, as I have clearly made an impact on her somehow."
    "Yumi has been fixed. "
    "I can now fade away into nothingness."

    y "…"
    s "…"
    y "Why are you sitting down?"
    s "Because we weren’t done talking yet."
    y "Okay, better question- why are you just staring at me like that? I can’t fucking eat with you watching me."
    s "Lick the ice cream, Yumi. "
    s "{i}Lick it.{/i}"

    scene wherethesidewalkends12
    with dissolve

    y "Jesus fucking Christ, you’re such a creep!"
    s "I’m sorry. It’s just so out of character. I can’t help myself."
    y "How is eating ice cream out of character?! I’m hungry and ice cream is good!"
    s "It’s also freezing out. Everything about this situation is exceedingly strange."

    scene wherethesidewalkends13
    with dissolve

    y "Yeah, I don’t think the dude who was standing still for five minutes and staring into an abyss has the authority to talk about what’s “strange.”"
    s "That part was strange, too. Everything about this event is strange."
    y "Event? The fuck are you on about now?"
    s "Never mind that. How are things?"
    y "{i}How are things?{/i}"
    y "Are we really just going to talk like normal people who like each other?"
    y "No “Yumi Revitalization Project” or “Stop calling Futaba fat” shit today?"
    s "I mean, I wanted to talk about whatever the magical powers you’re hiding from me are, but you seem pretty against that."
    y "I’m pretty against talking to you in general."
    s "Then I’ll just sit here and watch you eat your ice cream."
    y "That’s somehow even worse."
    s "Then say something."
    y "Say what?"
    s "I don’t know. "
    s "What are you going to be doing while Chika and I are at the hot spring?"
    y "Babysitting."
    s "Oh, right. Chinami can’t be alone for that long."
    y "I mean, she could. But she probably shouldn’t."
    y "Twerp is surprisingly independent for someone who can’t even do long division yet."
    s "Can you do long division, Yumi?"

        y "Oh, and you can’t make that stupid “You’re not even wearing pants” joke you made that one time because I actually {i}am{/i} wearing pants now."
        s "I’m surprised you still think I’m trying to do that with you. "
        s "I haven’t even touched you since-"

        scene wherethesidewalkends16
        with dissolve

        y "Nope. Gonna stop you right there."
        y "Told myself I’d move past that. And that’s gonna be really fuckin’ hard to do if you start talkin' about it all the time."
        s "That makes sense. But you see what I’m saying, don’t you?"
        y "Nope. Now, about Chinami-"
    else:
        y "Well, that's only because I'm too busy punching old people."
        y "Let's talk about that instead."

    "Well, I guess I can’t blame her for wanting to change the topic."
    "Getting her to admit that she’s starting to hate me less with each passing day will have to wait for some other time."
    "Unless I manage to ruin that somehow, which I don’t think is ever entirely out of the question."
    "…"
    "I probably shouldn’t ask her to lick the ice cream anymore."
    "I think that would be a good start."

    y "Chinami...seems weirdly attached to you. And I don’t get it."
    y "Like, she normally listens to me about everything. But no matter how much mean shit I say about you, she keeps saying that you’re nice and that you’re her new dad or some shit."

    scene wherethesidewalkends17
    with dissolve

    y "You’re not fuckin’ paying her or something, are you?"
    y "I know Chika won’t let her buy shit on the phone, so if you’re giving her money for micro-whatevers, that’s playing dirty."

    "Nope. Just paying for her entire phone bill."
    "Yours too."
    "Surprise."

    s "I’m not. "
    s "I don’t really get it either."
    s "I’m normally horrible with kids."
    y "Chinami ain’t some normal kid. She’s dealing with shit no one her age should ever have to deal with."
    y "Runaway dad. Dead mom. Can’t even go outside because she might get sick and die. "
    y "She’s worse off than even I was and I popped out of a fuckin’ heroin junkie into a Yakuza den."
    y "She’s weirdly strong and crazy smart, even if she says her own name all the fuckin' time."
    y "The one thing I don’t get, though, is you."
    y "Like, why?"
    s "Again, I have no idea. Sometimes people just like people even though they shouldn’t."
    y "Sounds like you’re talking about the entire fucking class when you put it like that."
    s "Maybe I am?"
    s "It’s not like I understand why everyone gravitates toward me. They just do."
    y "Not {i}everyone{/i}, chief. Let me remind you that I hate your fucking guts."
    y "And that I think Chika and Chinami are both insane for even letting you into their house."
    s "You know there’s probably something you could tell them if you really wanted to stop that, right?"

    scene wherethesidewalkends18
    with dissolve

    y "Yeah but I doubt they’d even fuckin’ believe me at this point."
    y "I already tried telling Chika all the weird shit about the detentions you used to give me and she basically called me a liar right to my face."
    y "And why the fuck would anyone else believe anything I tell them when they all like you more than me? "
    y "They’ll just think I’m trying to damage your reputation or some shit. I know how this game works."
    s "Just get them to like you then."

    s "So you could feel less lonely."

    y "I-"
    y "I’m not lonely! I like being alone!"
    y "It suits me!"
    s "Isn’t that because you make it suit you?"
    s "And what does that even mean? {i}Being lonely suits you?{/i}"
    y "It {i}means{/i} that I can get by on my own."
    y "And that I don’t need people who are dumb enough to fall for their fucking [high_school] teacher giving me life advice and shit."
    s "You don’t need to listen to anyone’s advice. But having people around isn’t a bad thing."
    s "Also, Chika has definitely fallen for me and you’re with her all the time."

    y "Yeah, so I know firsthand how fucking annoying it is to deal with it."
    y "Don’t know what this sudden fascination is with getting me to “change” or whatever, but just fucking stop. Okay?"
    s "Do you want me to stop helping you get a job as well?"
    y "Sure. Do whatever the fuck you want."
    s "I want to keep helping you."
    y "Well, fucking help me then. What are you even getting at?"
    s "Just trying to figure out what it is you really want."
    y "I want to be left alone. I’ve told you that a million times."

        y "And you promise you’ll leave?"
        s "Yes."
        y "And I don’t mean like, you’ll leave in ten minutes. You need to leave as soon as I do it."

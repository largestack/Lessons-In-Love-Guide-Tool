    s "Will you join forces with me and rule this land in the name of the Arakawas?"
    s "Or will you resign yourself to the cowardly Amamiyas? The same family who raised you and never told you of my existence..."

    scene battletwo9

    ay "But what hurts even more is knowing we are in love!"

    s "Well that’s just simply not true."

    scene battletwo15

    ay "How could you do this, father?!"
    ay "It’s one thing to abandon me by floating my body down the river-of-lost-hope, but to create a life-threatening disease in order to kill my adoptive parents?! "
    ay "That’s simply too much!"

    scene battletwo16
    with dissolve

    s "Funny. Some say “too much” while others say “not enough.”"
    s "Frankly, I thought about killing them much longer ago. "
    s "But six years ago, after I saw you training with a wooden sword next to your above-ground pool in the backyard, I decided I couldn’t."

    s "I didn’t even know that was a thing!"
    ay "So what’ll it be, Master Arakawa? Are you ready to concede to Todd, the only person who has ever bested you in battle?"
    ay "Or will you fight to the death, ultimately killing me in the process because we’re the same person? "
    ay "Or something."

    scene battletwo27

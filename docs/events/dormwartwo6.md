    "It feels wrong leaving one girl to meet up with another, but it feels even worse when your cum still clings to the fabric of the first girl’s clothes."
    "On the way to see Noriko, I think about what Futaba must be doing right now. Whether she decided to return to her friends...If she was even able to move in the first place..."
    "Or if she’s perhaps still sprawled out across the deep, red blankets that countless couples before us have defiled."
    "It’s thoughts like this that I try to save for when I’m alone- for they abruptly perish the moment another pretty face leaps into my field of vision."
    "The one I will see tonight is one of the prettiest of them all. "
    "But that’s not because she’s more suited to my tastes (She is)."
    "And it’s not because she’s one of the only girls who I think can handle the type of person I am beneath the masks I wear for everyone who’s not (She is)."
    "It’s not even because she’s my polar opposite (Once more, she is)."
    "Her face is one of the prettiest because it’s a face that dates back to before the other ones even existed in this makeshift world of mine."
    "My memories of it are buried right now, but I’ve been getting better at digging...and I believe that one day, even if it’s “years” from now, I’ll be able to unearth them."
    "And the only reason I can even think of things like that in the first place is because of people like her."
    "People who supplement my existence by being everything I need them to be...Who change themselves when I can’t figure out what that is."
    "The people I don’t deserve are always the ones who want me the most. And that’s horrible for everyone as it means they’re also the easiest to hurt."
    "So tonight, I will do my best to not lacerate the pale skin of a dream girl with the poison-tipped edge of a blade that is my tongue."
    "I will ask myself if this is worth it."
    "If her body can handle one more scar after all of the ones I’ve given her already."
    "And if she’s still beautiful despite wearing all of them for the whole world to see."

    n "You are. "
    n "I take it that means date number one went well?"
    s "Am I allowed to talk about date number one here? Because Futaba had a rule where I wasn’t allowed to bring you up."
    n "Do you always bring me up in conversations with other girls? Or were you just so excited to see me tonight that you weren’t able to hold it in?"
    s "If I was that excited, would I have really shown up this late?"
    n "Maybe. I {i}did{/i} make you come all the way to the center of the urban district after all. And all you had to do to meet up with Futaba was walk a few blocks."
    s "You’re right. Which means this better be the most exciting date I’ve ever had or it just won’t be worth the time commitment. "

    scene datewarnoriko3
    with dissolve

    n "I’ll do my best. I can’t guarantee my {i}strategy{/i} will be the same as hers, though. "
    n "Because instead of carefully curating a list of things you might like, I’ve decided to give you a taste of {i}my{/i} world instead..."
    n "Even if that taste leaves an uncomfortable or unfamiliar flavor on your tongue for the rest of the week."
    s "Are you some kind of criminal at night or something? What sort of things do you do that might leave a...bad flavor on my tongue?"

    n "Well, to start, I was thinking we could hit up my favorite male-dominated orgy spot. Then maybe follow that up by dropping acid together at the bottom of the sinkhole that claimed my Stratocaster. "
    n "Oh, and no night is complete without a trip to the nursing home- where we will pretend to be the grandchildren of Alzheimer's patients before stealing all of their wallets."
    n "This is all after making you eat a nine course vegan dinner featuring nothing but different variations of grilled tofu coated in American condiments, of course. Oh, and I’m also bringing my boyfriend. "
    s "Either you’re trying to lose on purpose through another reckless bout of self-sacrifice or we’re going to need to have a serious talk about your hobbies soon."

    scene datewarnoriko2
    with dissolve

    n "Sensei, I love you."
    s "Good, get it all out of your system before your “boyfriend” shows up."
    n "I will. Later. "
    n "I can’t guarantee it will be {i}all{/i} of it though, since I’ve been banking this love for what feels like a million years now."
    s "I don’t mind you saving some. I’m going to need it for the next male-dominated orgy to be sure that you’re still interested in me."
    n "You’re the only person I’ll ever be interested in."
    s "Then why do you keep running in the opposite direction?"

    scene datewarnoriko1
    with dissolve

    n "I’m hoping it’s for the same reasons it’s taking you so long to catch me."
    s "What does-"
    n "We should get going. Tickets to the orgy are 5,000 yen each, but I can spot you this time so long as you don’t try any weird positions on me while I have the helmet on."
    s "The...what?"

    n "Oh, and my safe word is “harder.” "
    s "That’s one of the actual worst words you could have chosen for that."
    n "I know. {i}I like the thrill.{/i}"

    "Noriko peels herself off of the bike rack she’s been clinging to and grabs my hand without so much as a second thought."
    "And while that’s fine given this {i}is{/i} a date and whatnot, I’m already receiving mixed signals about whether or not it’s okay to come any closer."
    "One minute, she wants me to be with her sister...The next, she’s telling me she loves me."
    "And that sort of back and forth would be fine if not for the fact that I can not even lift my head in this god damn city without seeing yet another face from my past."
    "One that looks so similar to the one beside me that I have to constantly remind myself it's not {i}her{/i} I am with."
    "But she watches us. "
    "She looks down with a fake smile plastered over her face as her eyes tear holes in the temporary, shared flesh of mine and Noriko’s hands."
    "She looks up as well when she realizes I’ve been doing it."
    "And then she loosens her grip."

    s "I’m not gonna lie, this is the single most {i}clothed{/i} orgy I’ve ever been to."
    n "Damn. If I knew you were so experienced, I would have taken you to the one on the roof of my old chiropractor’s building. I always loved {i}getting adjusted{/i} there."
    s "For the record, I’m not a big fan of this “joking about having sex with other guys” thing."
    n "Do you think {i}I’m{/i} a fan of having to constantly hear about you having sex with Kirin? "
    s "Wasn’t it you who said she gets to have my penis?"
    n "In a desperate attempt to keep clinging to you by any means necessary, yes."
    s "Do you want me to stop sleeping with her?"
    n "What do you think?"
    s "I think that you should start answering questions a little more honestly rather than trying to figure out what I {i}want{/i} your response to be."
    n "Are we having a talk now? Do you want to go back outside?"

    scene datewarnoriko6
    with dissolve

    s "No, it’s fine. I didn’t mean to bring the mood down. You’re obviously free to joke about whatever you want to joke about and I have nothing to do with it."
    n "Sensei, just for the record, I’m totally fine with you being a little possessive of me. And I don’t mind holding off on jokes like that in the slightest if they actually make you uncomfortable."
    s "If you’re going to keep changing yourself to fit my needs, at least do it quietly. It feels weird when you announce it out loud."
    n "Am I allowed to say “I’ll keep that in mind” or is that too close to doing the thing you literally just told me not to do?"
    n "You know what? Look at me and I’ll pretend to mouth some words or something and then you can just tell me the music in here is too loud and that you can’t hear me. Go."

    n "A live house. Or a venue. Whatever you want to call it. "
    n "It’s a place where local bands and artists come to play music and hang out. They do stuff like art galleries and flea markets on off days too. "
    n "Before I started going to Kumon-mi High, I would come here at least, like...three or four times a week."
    n "It’s dirty...and loud. And it smells kind of weird. And the girls’ restroom looks like somebody tossed a bag full of pipe bombs into it."
    n "But it also..."
    n "It also feels like home."
    n "I can’t really describe it."

    scene datewarnoriko11
    with dissolve

    n "The people...the music...the whole fucking scene..."
    n "It’s like a dopamine hit every time I step through the doors. A place where I can be the {i}real{/i} me. Not the one who subconsciously customized herself to appeal to you one day."
    n "Those parts of me are still real, don’t get me wrong. It’s extremely important to me to always be as genuine as I can, but that’s something I picked up from you a long time ago."
    n "It’s less...“make me into the girl you want me to be” and more...“aren’t you impressed by what I’ve become?”"
    s "Of course I’m impressed. And I know you’re your own person."

    scene datewarnoriko12
    with dissolve

    s "It just feels like sometimes you’re afraid of that."
    n "We’re all afraid of something. "
    n "But, let me ask you this...do you really think I would have brought you somewhere like {i}this{/i} if I was still trying to appeal to you?"
    n "This place is my...olive branch. My way of pulling you into my world because I want you to experience where I’ve been and {i}who I’ve become{/i} in the time we spent away from each other."
    n "It’s not enough to just live in your world anymore. "
    n "I want our worlds to collide."
    n "I want to love you in both of them."
    n "And I want {i}you{/i} to love me in them as well."
    s "But you also want me to love your sister...which makes this entire exchange shallow and hypocritical."

    n "I’m a fucking {i}teenager.{/i} I’m still growing in a bunch of different ways."
    n "You’re not hanging out with the complete version of Noriko Nakayarakawayama yet. I’m still just a prototype. And prototypes are always a little bit worse than the final version."
    n "So, for a while, I’m probably going to keep doing things you don’t understand. Hell, I’m probably going to keep doing things {i}I{/i} don’t understand. "
    n "But that isn’t me being flaky...It’s me trying to figure shit out."

    scene datewarnoriko14

    n "I’ve got all these different values and dreams...and I keep trying to shove them into this little box labeled “Noriko,” but it can only fit so much."
    n "And every single time I hypothetically sit down to hypothetically sort all of these hypothetical things I hypothetically hope to do one day...do you know what the first thing that goes into the box is?"
    s "It’s me, isn’t it?"

    n "Anyone who’s talked to me before has probably heard my story of “the one who got away” who...also happened to be my sister’s ex-boyfriend...But! That is beside the point!"
    n "Because, you see...I’ve had a streak of very good luck lately."
    n "Because not only was I able to reunite with him...I was able to start rekindling the relationship we once had..."

    "When she sings, she sings to me. And there are other people who can hear her, sure- but none of this matters to them."
    "I watch her fingers pluck away the strings, having no clue of how much talent or dexterity is required to play this song she apparently wrote herself, but I’m impressed nonetheless. Just like she wanted."
    "Is this good enough? "
    "Is my expression what you hoped for when you pictured yourself up on that stage?"
    "I attempt to contort my face into a smile and give up halfway through, causing a smirk to spawn at the corners of her lips as she understands I’m not good at that sort of thing."
    "What do I do in a position like this? There are people swaying in motion with the song, but...that’s not something I’d normally do, is it? Do I even know how?"
    "My stomach drops what feels like a whole inch for every second I think about it, but I know it shouldn’t. This song is too pretty to elicit a reaction like that. Right?"
    "I shouldn’t feel this way. This isn’t what she wants. This is supposed to make me happy."
    "{i}Am{/i} I happy? What do I feel? Why can’t I put a finger on it?"
    "That’s right. Fingers. I can go back to watching her play. That will keep my mind off of everything I- no. "
    "I locked eyes with her again. I locked eyes with her and her expression didn’t change at all. "
    "Did she expect me to look this way? How does she remain so focused?"
    "How can she freely express so much when I struggle to express anything at all?"
    "Is it because she’s simply that talented? (She is)"
    "Is it because she’s simply that determined? (She is)"
    "Or is it because she’s far more special...and far more important to me than I’ve given her credit for thus far? (Once more, she is)"
    "It is at this point that a woman standing beside me bumps her elbow into my bicep, likely expecting me to look over so she can say something like “Go get her” or anything comparable to that."
    "But, no matter how hard I try, I can not remove my eyes from Noriko."
    "She’s claimed them as her own and would be clutching them in the palms of her hands if they were not so busy enabling her seemingly endless serenade."
    "Make it stop."
    "Make these feelings go away."
    "I don’t want them anymore."

    ima "I mean, it’s not like I’ve wanted to go to school with uniforms for my entire life or anything. And it’s not like you guys are only a little younger than me {i}or anything!{/i}"

    "Just as Imani said, it looks like all of the girls have changed into their new uniforms and that we no longer have roughly half the class decked out in one that I never thought was flattering to begin with."
    "Also, it looks like all of them are {i}still here{/i} with the exception of the one girl who’s never here to begin with. "
    "But hey, if Yumi is gone, at least my days will be easier and filled with less profanity."

    m "Uhh...did something happen to Miku? She looks unusually...{i}not loud{/i} today."

    scene summerclass5
    with dissolve

    ima "Ahh...yeah."
    ima "The school decided to do away with all of the intramural sports teams since none of them had anybody to play against and were running low on members anyway. "
    ima "The soccer team just happened to be among the casualties. She’s looked pretty down ever since I came in this morning."

    ima "Besides, we’ve got plenty of other sports clubs still going strong! Or...ones that are on the cusp of going strong but...haven’t actually {i}started{/i} yet. "
    ima "What I’m trying to say is that there’s no shortage of excuses for her to be active. But yeah, kinda sucks when something you love gets taken away."
    ima "But anyway! I guess I’m gonna do the thing now since we’re already like two hours behind thanks to all of the fluids you had to clean off of each other."
    m "What? Ew. Why would you even say something like that? Aren’t you supposed to be the good teacher?"
    ima "No way! I’m the young and quirky one who you’re all supposed to look up to because I am both an intellectual {i}and{/i} super cool."
    ima "Also, I think I see a little love juice stuck in your hair, so I’m just gonna-"
    m "Touch me and I will kill you."
    ima "Jeeeez. {i}Somebody{/i} needs a post-coitus cigarette."

    scene summerclass7

    ay "Ghana."
    m "I didn’t mean {i}literally{/i}. I mean how is a borderline predator as a teacher any better than an actual predator?"
    s "Technically, she’s a {i}student{/i} teacher."
    ay "Yeah. Sensei is teaching her how to become a full predator and it falls on you and me to serve as examples to help her learn."

    m "Please tell me this isn’t just how you’re going to be now. "
    ay "But Maya, all that’s really changed about me is that I know we’re rivals now. And I think that’s something we can bond over."
    m "We are rivals over nothing and anything you {i}thought{/i} you heard was simply apocalypse-induced delirium. "
    ay "That’s fine. I’ll just have to be the {i}only{/i} test subject for Imani’s predatorial lessons. "
    ay "I sure hope my body can handle it."

    scene summerclass12

    ay "You’re going to make the cake for your own surprise party?"
    a "Well, yeah. I don’t trust anyone else and I assume Sensei is going to eat it, so..."
    m "Okay, well...I’m going to go sit down and...try and sort out my thoughts for the...uhh...{i}surprise party.{/i} But the three of you are free to continue standing around and...being weird."

    scene summerclass16
    with dissolve

    a "Wait, before you sit down, are we still going to karaoke with Uta after class? Because Io apparently bailed on her and it makes me feel weird how she’s always going there to sing all by herself."
    m "Uhhhhhhh...{i}yes?...{/i}"
    a "Why do you sound so unsure? Do you hate Uta now? Or...wait! Do you hate {i}me?{/i}"
    m "Uhhhhhhh..."
    m "{i}No?...{/i}"

    mi "The team is..."

    scene summerclass26

    mi "That ain’t what it’s about! That ain’t ever been what’s it about!"
    ki "They’re not gone, Miku...I’m still here. {i}Karin’s{/i} still here. We’re just...going our separate ways now."

    mak "There’s always the swim club as well, Miku. And it’s got an Olympic size pool, so you’d be able to get as much energy out as you want."

    scene summerclass28
    with dissolve

    mi "I’m sorry you guys feel like you’ve gotta cheer me up. I’ve known about this for weeks, so the fact that I’m cryin’ about it now must seem pretty stupid, huh?"

    ki "Yeah! But that doesn’t mean there aren’t other parts that won’t be enjoyable! "

    ki "Yeah, but it’s not like archery {i}isn’t{/i} active. Have you ever tried using a longbow? That shit’s exhausting, prez."
    mak "I didn’t say it wasn’t. But I do think that maybe we should be taking Miku’s best interests into consideration and weighing which options would most closely correlate to what she’s used to."

    scene summerclass30

    ki "I {i}did{/i} that, Makoto. I’m sure I don’t have to remind you of how long Miku and I have been on a team together, do I?"
    mak "Do you actually think that compares to how long {i}I’ve{/i} been with Miku for? Because-"
    mi "If you guys are just gonna fight over me, go back to yer own desks. I’ll join whichever club I feel like joinin’."
    mi "But right now, I just...kinda wanna be left alone."

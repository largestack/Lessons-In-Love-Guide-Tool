    "I emerge from the teacher’s lounge and make my way over to the cafeteria, hoping to bump into Ami or Ayane so I can ask them for some lunch money."
    "Do I have my own money? Yes. Of course I do."
    "I am a functioning adult."
    "But if I’m able to save a few hundred yen every here and there, I can even start cancelling out the Chosokabes' phone bill- a thing I often forget I’m even paying for."
    "Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like anyone I know is around, so I’m just going to have to figure out something when I get to the-"

    u "Oh! Good timing!"
    u "Sensei! Over here! Look behind you!"
    s "Hm?..."

    w "Please explain to me why this girl is ruining the only thirty minutes I have to myself in this god-forsaken place."
    s "I wish I had an answer for you."
    u "So, Sensei, it’s been a couple days and Io still isn’t in our class yet, so I figured I might as well start reaching out on your behalf."
    u "You know Ms. Watabe, right?"
    s "Yeah, we have a suicide pact together."
    u "Awesome. "
    u "That’s a closer bond than I was expecting, so why don’t we start this transaction up right now? Do either of you two have a pen?"
    w "I have no pen. I will sign in my blood."

    with dissolve

    u "Uhh...do you need someone to talk to, Ms. Watabe?"
    w "I need everyone to go away."
    s "I’m pretty sure she was joking, Uta. Contrary to how she looks, Ms. Watabe is a ball of sunshine just waiting to share her joy with the world."

    scene utawakana3
    with dissolve

    w "Ugh...what’s even the point of this?"
    w "I already told you that you can have anyone you want."
    w "Just fill out the paperwork...inform the principal...and the job is done."
    w "Now, begone. I want to get back to my food."
    s "What are you eating, if you don’t mind me asking?"
    s "Boiled newts? Lizard eggs?"
    w "A convenience store bento, you single-minded, unobservant bastard."
    w "Our desks are literally right next to each other in the lounge. I eat the same thing every single day."
    s "It’s becoming stranger and stranger that we’ve never talked until recently."

    scene utawakana4
    with dissolve

    u "So, just to make sure I’m on the same page as you two, all that needs to be done is a little paperwork?"
    w "And obtaining the principal’s approval, yes. He needs to sign off on things like that."
    w "Talk to Miyamura. She’ll know how to handle it."
    u "That’s the other girl with glasses in the class, right? I can do that. We can bond over our poor vision."
    s "Thank you for confirming that those are not just cosmetic. I’d been wondering that since the other day."

    scene utawakana5
    with dissolve

    u "You thought I was wearing these for the sake of being cute?! They make my eyes like a zillion times bigger!"
    u "Do you have an eye fetish, Sensei?!"
    u "That’s so weird! What other kind of weird stuff are you into?!"
    u "Close your ears, Ms. Watabe! I have no idea what this guy is going to say next!"
    w "The way you run your class worries me more and more every day."
    s "I’ve found it’s best to just let it run itself."
    w "I can tell how well it’s working from how long this girl has been holding onto the sleeve of my dress."
    s "Maybe she just really likes the dress? I think it looks great on you."
    w "I agree. It matches the color of my soul."

    scene utawakana6
    with dissolve

    u "Ahh! Stop flirting with each other and just get Io into the class already! She’s gonna die in Ms. Watabe’s room at this rate!"
    w "So will I, most likely. "
    w "Destined to wander the halls of the[school] as a ghost and have first-years tell tales of the Wailing Wakana."
    s "That {i}does{/i} have a certain ring to it."
    w "Wailing Witch, Wakana Watabe sounds even better."
    s "How much thought have you put into this?"
    w "What else am I supposed to think about while everyone has their noses buried in textbooks?"
    w "Oh, sorry. You don’t actually {i}teach{/i}, so that’s not a question you’d be able to answer."

    scene utawakana7
    with dissolve

    u "Okay. Sensei, you and me are gonna go find the class-rep and have her show us how to do the thingamajig."
    u "If I have to spend one more night in that dorm alone, I’m gonna flip. "
    u "That Molly girl stays up all hours of the night yelling about stuff and the hallway always smells like ramen."
    s "I’m glad to see room-six has made that substantial of an impact."
    u "Also, why are there so many empty rooms up there? Why can’t we just move some of the other girls from downstairs up to that floor?"
    s "Hey, I don’t make the rules."
    w "You don’t enforce them, either, apparently."
    w "Physical contact between teachers and students is prohibited...and this girl {i}still{/i} has her hand on me for some reason."

    if bonus == True:
        "The first part of that sentence started to make me a little worried, but I’m glad it was just more of Wakana being self-centered."
    else:
        s "Wait, does that include hugs?"
        w "Yes."
        s "D= !!!!!!!!!!!"

    u "You want me to let go? Fine! I’ve got stuff to do anyway!"
    u "Class-A rules! Class-B is dumb! And Sensei would totally beat you in a fight!"
    w "All I wanted was to eat my bento...why does this cursed building always torment me so?"

    "Uta removes her hand from Ms. Watabe’s dress and decides to grab me instead, pulling me down the hall on the way to the..."

    s "Wait, where are we even going?"
    u "The classroom!"
    s "It’s lunch-time. Makoto is probably in the cafeteria with Miku right now."
    s "Or the roof, maybe? I don’t really know where she spends her lunches, to be honest."
    u "Well then...I’ll go check the cafeteria and you go check the roof! I don’t think I’m allowed up there anyway."
    s "Neither am I, I don’t think. But that’s never really stopped me before."

    "Uta and I break apart, heading in separate directions. "
    "Just when I round the corner to head for the stairs, though, {i}fate{/i} (If it even exists) does something interesting."

    "I find Io standing at the window, overlooking a sudden half-blizzard busy dusting tables and benches with snow."
    "She looks quite...despondent compared to how she was at the bathhouse. "
    "Could this be the result of those [high_school] woes I’ve so commonly started citing despite not remembering how things even were for me back then?"
    "I guess."
    "But I still don’t know much about Io."
    "Hell, for all I know, someone she loves could have just died- and reaching out to her about why she’s just standing around instead of eating would do more harm than good."
    "Or maybe she’s not hungry?"
    "From this angle, it’s easy to tell just how skinny she is."
    "Do skinny people even get hungry?"

    s "…"

    "I flood my mind with any stray thought I can think of to distract me from speaking up and grabbing her attention."
    "Maybe it’s because I hate helping people?"
    "Or-"
    "Maybe it’s because she looks beautiful enough in this moment that it would be a sin to disturb her?"

    i "…"

    i "…"

    "Damn."
    "She found me."

    s "Hey. "
    i "Hey."
    i "You’re not planning on asking me why I’m up here instead of in the cafeteria or anything, are you?"
    s "Not anymore, I'm not."
    s "I was leaning toward you not being hungry, in case you were wondering."
    i "Leaning toward?"
    i "What other possibilities did you come up with while you were staring at me?"
    s "The only other notable one was that a loved one died."
    i "Wow, straight to the dark stuff. "
    s "So, which one’s right? Lack of hunger or abundance of grief?"

    scene utawakana10
    with dissolve

    i "Lack of hunger is closer, but it’s more of a mix of things."

    scene utawakana11
    with dissolve

    i "Where’s Uta? "
    s "Looking for the class-rep so she can start the process of getting you on our team."
    i "Figures. She hasn’t shut up about it ever since dragging you to the bathhouse the other day."
    s "Are you still excited?"
    i "A little."
    i "The initial excitement wore off when I realized I’d still be surrounded by a bunch of other people I don’t know."
    i "But at least Uta will be there."
    i "Oh, and you seem cool, too. So we can be friends if you want. "

    if bonus == True:
        i "That discount I brought up the other day is still on the table as well."
        s "And the offer to peek on Uta?"

        scene utawakana12
        with dissolve

        i "Coincidentally, I just-so-happen to eat dinner around the time she comes over to bathe, so I’d never really know to begin with."
        s "You are way cooler with the prospect of an older man perving out on your best friend than you should be."
        i "It’s more that I just...don't care."
        s "As long as you know you’re literally enabling me by giving away all this info."
    else:
        s "I can't be your friend, Io."
        i "But why?"
        s "Because I watched you sneak into my house last night and try to hide a can of soup under my bed."
        i "I just wanted to fit in. Uta said that's a thing that you all do for some reason."
        s "You are a bad girl, Io. Only Makoto and I can hide the soup."
        s "It is {i}our{/i} thing. Not yours."

    scene utawakana13
    with dissolve

    i "You’re right. I’m a bad friend."
    i "I should get better at hiding certain things."

    if bonus == False:
        s "I hope you are not talking about soup."

    i "But hiding things takes so much effort."
    i "Like, I’m sure you have plenty of stuff you wish you could just tell everybody, right?"
    i "Stuff that eats away at you. Changes your perspective. Keeps you awake at night."
    i "Ruins your life, even."
    i "Do you have anything like that?"
    i "Or would even admitting that without providing any details be too much of a secret for you to give away?"

    "If anything, I have too many secrets."
    "But I don’t think there’s anything I’m...tired of concealing."
    "I’d actually go as far as saying it would be even more tiring to reveal all of those ideas or happenings I’ve tucked away somewhere."
    "Io is just different, apparently. And that’s fine. "
    "I can’t imagine her secrets are in the same boat as mine anyway."

    s "I’m not really sure what to say to that."
    i "It was mostly rhetorical anyway. "
    s "..."
    s "You seem a little different when you’re alone."
    i "Is that a bad thing?"
    s "Not necessarily. Especially considering you really only have Uta now."
    i "Not just {i}now{/i}. I only had Uta in my other[school], too. "
    i "But that’s a calculated move on my part. "
    i "I’m sure I could make friends if I truly wanted to."
    s "And here I was thinking you were some sort of outcast who was just feeling lonely without knowing anyone in a new environment."
    i "Something like that would be a lot simpler."
    i "Instead, I put on my uniform every morning...pull up my stockings...and proceed to mislead everyone about the person I really am for the next seven hours or so."
    i "But, like I was saying, keeping secrets is tiring. And seven hours is a long time."
    i "Do you have any idea how many secrets [teenage]girls have?"
    i "Even stuff that isn’t a secret becomes a secret with them."
    i "And before you know it, you’ve got an entire archive of things you can’t reveal to specific subsets of girls or cliques or blah-blah-blah."

    scene utawakana14
    with dissolve

    i "Frankly, I hate it."
    i "One of the reasons I like Uta so much is that she doesn’t really have any secrets. "
    i "She’s the kind of girl that just reveals everything about herself instinctively, so there’s nothing I need to worry about accidentally letting slip."
    s "...Why are you telling me all this?"
    s "Where is this coming from?"

    scene utawakana15
    with dissolve

    i "Huh? What do you mean?"
    s "I’m just confused as to why you’re suddenly opening up to me despite making it sound like the only relationship you need is the one you have with Uta."

    scene utawakana16
    with dissolve

    i "Oh. Okay. I get what you mean."
    i "Yeah, it probably feels a little weird hearing all of that when you just showed up at this window by chance today."
    i "Uta’s not the only person I need. "
    i "I need all kinds of people and all kinds of things."
    i "I’m incredibly high maintenance in the lowest maintenance way possible."
    i "But, you see-"
    i "Right now-"

    scene utawakana17

    i "…"
    i "Right now-"
    i "I kind of just want somebody to watch the snow with."
    i "I can’t guarantee you’ll like getting to know me or that I’ll like getting to know you."
    i "But, for some strange reason-"
    i "It's harder to erect walls when you're around."

    i "That was all me. I was just making a joke."

    i "I guess we’ll be able to watch the snow fall together after all, huh?"
    i "Thanks again for taking a chance on me."
    i "I’m sure I came across a little weird today, so I’ll try not to be as...{i}me{/i} as possible tomorrow."
    i "No promises, though."
    u "What is it with all this heckin’ flirting today? I’m the one who did all the work and nobody is flirting with me."

    "The three of us walk to the cafeteria together and, by the time we get there, the lunch period is already about to come to a close."
    "I try to break apart, but they reel me back in and I get coaxed into buying the two of them drinks."
    "It’s funny. "
    "I started this period with the full intention of taking money {i}from{/i} others and wound up spending money {i}on{/i} others instead."
    "I guess even I can have good moments every once in a while."
    "…"
    "I wonder, though-"
    "What did Io mean by “High maintenance in the lowest maintenance way possible?”"
    "That’s a strange thing to say."
    "Granted, a lot of what she said today didn’t exactly click with me."
    "But I can’t imagine she’s even half as complex as someone like Maya and I’ve been dealing with her pretty...adequately, I guess."
    "I’ll just have to wait and see what that’s all about. "
    "There’s no other way around it."
    "I’m sure it’ll make a little more sense the more time I spend with her, though..."

    "The seven second intervals separating Maya’s dream-induced twitches disappear along with the reluctant acceptance that I will never see her again."
    "I think I must have inherited them, as my body interprets this miraculous turn of events as an attack on itself- or at least the remnants of gods still circulating throughout my bloodstream."
    "A flood of unfamiliar feelings fills my heart and subsequently the rest of me, draining every last lingering ounce of divinity out of my veins and into a lurking container housing only half of a man."
    "Perhaps this will be the wake-up call I need."
    "Or perhaps I’ll take it as proof that there never was a god. For if there {i}was{/i} or if there {i}is,{/i} this is certainly not an act on their behalf."
    "It simply doesn’t match their preferred form of comedy."

    "Two pairs of empty eyes meet in the darkest corner of a bedroom and exchange absolutely nothing."
    "They latch onto each other because the idea of looking anywhere else reminds them that straying too far from home can be dangerous."
    "But in that moment, the hosts of each pair of eyes are reminded that there has never been anywhere that has felt like home at all."
    "And that all they have ever done is stray."

    "I thank Ayane for convincing me to look in the first place."
    "I thank myself and the circumstances and everything I can think of except whatever forces brought us to this dark corner."
    "All that remains at this point is to find a home."
    "To find a place to come back to so neither one of us ever has to stray again. "
    "But before that-"
    "A celebration is in order."

    "This is not the first time I’ve had the misfortune of feeling the tears of a young girl seep through the fabric of my shirt."
    "It is, however, the first time I have not felt an immediate compulsion to get changed."
    "These are the most welcome tears I have ever felt."
    "So why can’t I bring myself to embrace her back?"
    "Is it because of the shock? "
    "Because just moments ago I was unsure of whether or not I’d ever get to experience something like this?"
    "Is it because of fear? "
    "Because I {i}have{/i} subconsciously began to heed her warnings and keep my distance?"
    "Or is it because I now understand the gravity of exactly what that means?"
    "And that the world itself is not what will come to an end-"
    "But that it would be one of {i}us{/i} that does."
    "And that is somehow even worse."

    "Maya releases her grip on my shirt and the markings left by her tears quickly turn from hot to cold in what seems like a direct mirror of her mood tonight."
    "She wipes the ones not caught by my clothing off with her hands before bringing them to her own shirt and causing us to match in one more subtle way."
    "The good thing is that only one set of empty eyes remains now."
    "The bad thing is that they belong to me-"
    "And that even now, I can’t help but put myself first. "

    ay "I thought you were {i}gone...{/i}"
    ay "I came in here twice...and I couldn’t see you either time...I don’t understand..."
    ay "If it wasn’t for Sensei, I never would have-"

    with dissolve

    s "Ayane, if it wasn’t for you, I’d probably still be moping around on the roof right now. You’re the one who helped me get off of my ass and actually do something."
    ay "Yes, but-"
    s "Don’t beat yourself up about the weird mechanics surrounding the end of the world. Especially now that we know Maya doesn’t really understand them either."

    scene resetwithmaya9
    with dissolve

    m "Excuse me- I never claimed to be an expert at this. But, just for curiosity’s sake, exactly what are you referring to right now?"
    s "The fact that Ayane’s back again and not pregnant."
    m "Yeah, I still don’t believe that."

    scene resetwithmaya10
    with dissolve

    ay "Why don’t you ever believe me when I tell you I’m not pregnant?! I know my body better than you do, Maya!"
    m "What’s more concerning than that is how you managed to wake me up."
    s "What do you mean?"
    m "I mean that I have tried that with you many times in the past and, without beating around the bush, it has always ended up rather catastrophically. "
    s "Catastrophically {i}how?{/i}"

    scene resetwithmaya11
    with dissolve

    m "It...would probably be best to leave the details out for now. "
    s "Well, I don’t like that at all."
    m "The fact that Ayane wasn’t able to see me is...curious, though. And calls into question a number of different things I’ve never really thought about before."
    m "It’s a shame she’s going to forget all of this yet again once we make it back to the roof."

    scene resetwithmaya12
    with dissolve

    ay "You think I’m going to...forget again?"
    m "Why wouldn’t I? That has happened 100%% of the times you’ve shown up during a reset. I have no reason to believe it won’t happen again."
    ay "That was just one time, though...right? Nobody knows if that’ll happen-"
    m "Nobody knows, that is correct. But I wouldn’t get my hopes up if I were you."
    m "Plus, I’m kind of rooting for your memory to get wiped right now so I don’t have to live with the embarrassment of all the things I just said."
    m "It’s bad enough that {i}he{/i} heard them. And, if it weren’t for the {i}dream{/i} I just had, I’d call the idea of {i}you{/i} hearing those things as well my worst nightmare."
    s "You should be a little nicer to her, Maya. Ayane was willing to sacrifice her life to go out and look for you, you know."

    scene resetwithmaya13
    with dissolve

    m "I’m both flattered and thankful...truly. But what the two of you did was not only a complete shot in the dark, but an extremely foolish one at that."
    m "What would you have done if you attempted to wake me up and something horrible happened to me? How would you live with yourselves knowing that {i}you{/i} were the cause?"
    s "Probably the same way we’d live knowing we left this place...or...{i}time{/i} without you."
    s "Plus, even if {i}anyone can do it,{/i} resetting the world isn't my job. It's yours."

    scene resetwithmaya14
    with dissolve

    m "Sure. Leave the praying to one person who hates the gods more than you do. Fantastic idea."
    ay "So...what happens now? Should we...maybe check the other dorm rooms?"
    ay "If Sensei was able to see {i}you,{/i} maybe he can-"

    scene resetwithmaya15
    with dissolve

    m "Unlikely. And it’s not something we should risk regardless. "
    m "Judging the flow of time here is nigh impossible as it seems to come to a standstill. But given the fact that this is the first time in history that I’ve been the last one to wake up, I don’t want to take any chances."
    m "We need to get this over with as quickly as possible. And, should you still be there when we return, {i}then{/i} we can talk about what’s going to happen next."

    scene resetwithmaya16
    with dissolve

    m "After we decide on a name for the baby, that is."
    ay "Ha ha ha. Very funny."

    scene resetwithmaya17

    m "On a brighter note...thank you, Ayane."
    m "I greatly appreciate it and now feel quite horrible with myself for all of the times I watched you fade away into nothingness."

    "What Maya said about the flow of time here must be accurate as everything seems to come to a standstill while we’re inside of the dorms."
    "In fact, I’m so caught up in my head about the prospect of how this will play out next time that I can’t even bring myself to focus on the girls as they change back into their casual clothes in front of me."
    "Maya shows restraint at first, but Ayane’s adamance about no one leaving each other’s sight again quickly coerces her into changing her stance and..."
    "Well, paired with the fact that Maya has, once again, all but confessed her feelings to me, taking off her clothes must not seem like that big of a deal in the end."

    scene clearnightsky
    with dissolve2

    "It’s funny, isn’t it? How quickly the idea of tragedy can cause one’s mind to spiral out of control. And how the overturning of said tragedy brings us right back to the starting line."
    "Somewhere, a wooden carving of a god is laughing itself to death inside of a glass box, knowing full well that it is the icon of all that is unjust in this world."
    "And that each and every one of us who pay admission prices to gaze into its empty eyes are attempting to translate and disfigure that laughter into a series of noises that provide us some form of comfort."
    "I ask you, what is there to be comfortable about here?"
    "How can anyone find comfort knowing that, at any second, the things they need the most can be stripped away without warning?"
    "There is no reason to laugh. "
    "There is no reason to smile."

    m "Can you two please take this seriously?"
    ay "Hey, I don’t even know what I’m supposed to do yet. Sensei told me hours ago that you’d fill me in on all of the details, but then you weren’t here and we had that big heartfelt reunion and-"

    s "Where have you taken me?"
    t "Out of all of the stereotypical first date locations, I figured an amusement park would carry the lowest probability of us touching one another."
    s "My only condition is that Io can never know that this happened."
    t "My only condition is that Noodles can never know that this happened. He has been begging me to come here ever since it opened."

    s "How do you even know about this place? You’re the one who’s supposed to be oblivious to basically anything you haven’t grown up with."
    t "That is nonsense. I am a hip and trendy girl who keeps up with the times. And you are nothing more than a bean sprout who sat at the bottom of the bag for too long."
    s "What does that even mean?"
    t "That you are a moist and unappetizing bacterial sponge. I can’t believe I agreed to go on a date with you."
    s "This was literally your idea."

    scene unexpecteddate3
    with dissolve

    t "I have no idea what you are talking about. But I suppose that, since we are here, we should find a way to pass the time."
    t "Are there any rides that you would like to go on? You should be tall enough to access all of them."
    s "We can do whatever you want. I don’t really care one way or the other."
    t "That puts us in quite the predicament then as I am afraid of amusement park rides."

    scene unexpecteddate4
    with dissolve

    s "Then why would we-"
    t "There are a surprising amount of people here for a weekday, wouldn’t you agree?"
    s "I...have no-"
    t "Please stand at least five feet away from me at all times so none of them think that we are physically involved. You are ruining my reputation."

    scene unexpecteddate5
    with dissolve

    s "I don’t like date-Tsuneyo. She’s confusing. And that’s saying a lot since normal Tsuneyo is an enigma rivaling even the most mysterious...mysteries of the universe. "
    s "Which, fortunately, allows me to segue into the reason I wanted to talk to you today. You-"
    t "Can we not ignore your motivations for the time being and focus simply on enjoying ourselves? If I wanted to fret over the mysterious mysteries of the universe, I would just microwave a banana."
    s "What does that even-"
    t "There must be something that two people who are afraid of amusement park rides should be able to do at an amusement park."
    s "I never said I was afraid. I’d be fine with riding something so long as you-"

    scene unexpecteddate6
    with dissolve

    t "It’s okay. I won’t think any less of you if you just tell the truth. It’s a shame, though. I was really looking forward to riding the most thrilling, fast-paced attractions this place has to offer. Oh well."
    s "..."
    t "Oh, look. Food."

    scene unexpecteddate7
    with dissolve

    "Tsuneyo wanders off and I retract any fleeting thoughts I may have had earlier about a future where the two of us grow close. "
    "This is not a life I want to live. "
    "And should a moment arise today that does not involve me being strung along, I should thank her for showing me that and saving me from what would surely be an exhausting alternate universe."

    t "Oh, I forgot my wallet. "
    tako2 "THEN NO TAKOYAKI FOR YOU!"
    t "Please wait one moment. My husband will take care of the bill."
    tako2 "HE BETTER! I WENT THROUGH SO MUCH TROUBLE TO MAKE YOU THESE!"
    t "I understand. But any minute now, he will show up and everything will be okay."
    s "..."
    t "Any minute now."
    s "..."
    t "Please wait one moment."

    t "What are you doing? I gave you the signal."
    s "Oh, my bad. I didn’t realize we were married. I must have missed the ceremony."
    t "You did, but I will forgive you in exchange for money. I require immediate assistance. The octopus salesman is becoming unruly. "
    s "You should probably make sure you have cash on you before trying to buy something next time."
    t "Marrying you was clearly a mistake. I deserve to be valued just as much as anyone else."

    scene unexpecteddate7
    with dissolve

    t "This is my husband. He will pay for me."
    tako2 "AIN’T HE A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR YOU?!"
    t "Do not project your beliefs onto us. We are in love and in dire need of oversized octopus balls."
    tako2 "STOP LYING TO ME! GET AWAY FROM MY STALL!"
    t "You just wait until my husband hears you raising your voice at me."

    s "Are you happy now?"
    t "I would be happier if I was not just yelled at. What an unpleasant man."
    t "I also don’t understand why he had to arrange this dish in such an obscene manner. I feel rather uncomfortable eating it."
    s "Eat it quickly. There are children here."

    scene unexpecteddate10
    with dissolve

    t "I have an idea. "
    s "That’s nice. Keep it to yourself."
    t "I refuse as I can not imagine any other way that we will be able to drag this day out longer. "
    s "Then let’s call it quits. I liked the idea of giving it a shot earlier, but this is clearly not working."
    t "That is because we have been going about things all wrong and you are too cowardly to ride the rollercoasters with me."
    s "Yup. You got me."
    t "Thank you for admitting it. That must have taken a lot of courage. But you do not need to fear any longer, for my new idea involves nothing but eating for the rest of the afternoon. And then the night."
    s "You go ahead but I highly doubt I can continuously eat for the next eight or nine hours."
    t "Not with that attitude, you can’t."
    s "I doubt you can either. You’ve barely even touched your titjobyaki."

    scene unexpecteddate11
    with dissolve

    t "This will make an excellent anecdote if I am ever allowed to perform stand-up comedy again."
    s "Yeah...I think it would be best for everyone if you explore other options for the time being."
    t "Excellent idea. Let us go eat something slightly less sexual in nature. I am not yet prepared for this."
    s "I spent 2,000 yen on that. You are going to-"

    scene unexpecteddate12
    with dissolve

    t "Oh no. I seem to have dropped it. What a terrible accident."
    tako2 "YOU FUCKING WHORE! I HOPE YOU DIE!"

    scene unexpecteddate13
    with dissolve

    s "Hey. Don’t say that about my wife."
    tako2 "I’m sorry, Sir. Would you like another serving?"
    s "No thanks. We’ll be taking our business elsewhere."

    scene unexpecteddate14

    s "Right, Tsuneyo?"
    t "{i}Ahem...{/i}"
    t "That’s...right. "

    scene unexpecteddate15
    with dissolve

    t "Come, H...Husband. We will now begin the second phase of our food tour."

    "Did Tsuneyo...actually get a little flustered just now?"

    s "..."

    "Should I be doing nice things for the girls more often?..."

    scene unexpecteddate16
    with dissolve

    tako2 "Ahhhh! I did it again, Frank! Why do I always have to get so nervous around pretty girls?!"
    fff "Don’t cry, man. You’ll figure it one day. You’ve just gotta keep at it."
    tako2 "My dad will never love me at this rate! I’m nothing but a disappointment! I should have been a painter!"
    fff "Don’t say that, buddy. I think you’re great."
    tako2 "You don’t understand! I could’ve had class! I could’ve been a contender! I could’ve been somebody! Instead of a bum...which is what I am. Let’s face it..."
    fff "Hey, here’s an idea. How about we hit up the strip club after this? Chances are it’ll be pretty empty since we somehow managed to dodge the draft. Will that cheer you up, pal?"
    tako2 "...Maybe."

    scene black

    tako2 "Or maybe I’ll just fuck that up too!"

    "........."
    "......"

    scene unexpecteddate17
    with dissolve2

    "The second phase of our apparent food tour takes us to a booth specializing in yakitori which, of course, I wind up paying for as well on account of my date being entirely useless."

    t "Simple, yet enticing...and grilled to perfection. You can tell just how much care and experience was poured into making these."
    s "Can you? Because we haven’t even eaten any yet."
    t "The first step of eating happens with one’s eyes. That’s why many shops have dishes set up in window-displays."
    s "Sure, but...that’s still not actually {i}eating.{/i} Like, no one passes by a window and thinks, “I’m full now. Time to go home.”"

    scene unexpecteddate18
    with dissolve

    t "Do you think it might be advantageous if Tojo Ramen were to incorporate such a display? Are you more likely to stop in somewhere if you can see what they have to offer first?"
    s "I guess, but...could you even afford that? Your shop doesn’t have any windows and it’s not like you get a lot of foot traffic either."

    scene unexpecteddate19
    with dissolve

    t "I suppose that is true. I’m just not sure what else a business can do when it falls into the same predicament my family’s store is in."
    t "There are many steps you can take to revitalize a dying business, but it becomes significantly harder when the business is only dying due to its location’s population thinning out."
    t "With winter on the brink of returning, I have some hope for a change in fortune. But I’d be foolish to not worry of what may happen if I am not so lucky."
    s "I think the only option at that point would be to move the store elsewhere, wouldn’t it?"

    scene unexpecteddate20
    with dissolve

    t "..."
    t "It’s true that such a feat may help. And I understand that inheriting the family business means that I will need to make certain changes in order to adapt to the times."
    t "But Tojo Ramen is more than just a small, windowless ramen shop. It is a gateway to the past...a means of transporting people back to when things were simpler. "
    t "Before franchises with diminishing standards...or misguided restaurants that care more about turning a profit than providing a quality product."
    s "Would you not be able to...do all that somewhere else? "
    t "It wouldn’t be the same."
    t "Tojo Ramen is my home. My entire life had taken place there until recently. Abandoning it in pursuit of something newer would feel like abandoning a piece of myself."
    t "Not to mention the toll it would take on my father. I’m not sure he could survive a move in his current condition."
    s "Well, not to be morbid...but you know he won’t be around forever, right?"
    t "I have come to accept that, yes. But it does not mean I am comfortable with it or...unworried of its potential consequences. "
    t "I’m simply unsure of my capability to make such a substantial change. It would be more like starting over than repairing what I currently have."
    s "Then I guess it comes down to whether or not you believe what you have can even be repaired in the first place. Sounds like that’s what you have to figure out before you worry about moving or anything."
    t "I know that. But any time such a thought crosses my mind, I become too sad to think properly. "
    t "It seems to be a never-ending cycle."

    scene unexpecteddate21
    with dissolve

    s "Cycle- right. I need your help with something. I-"
    t "Do you think there is anywhere here that sells noodles? I grow weary of these noodle-free dishes and know exactly what it is that will cheer me up."
    s "I mean...I’m sure there’s somewhere. But I need to talk to you about-"

    scene unexpecteddate22

    "That’s several times today that Tsuneyo has changed topics without giving me the chance to explain why I came looking for her in the first place."
    "It’s not a good omen for things to come at this point...which is upsetting since I was really beginning to believe that she might be onto something after what she said on the beach."
    "But I guess her connection or...understanding or whatever it is concerning the nature of these cycles is not as strong as Yumi’s."
    "Tsuneyo was never directly affected like she was. She just kind of...accidentally picked up on things? "
    "Maybe that’s not enough to go off of. "
    "Maybe it was just a coincidence that she felt something like that, but-"

    t "One, please. My husband will pay."

    "But..."
    "I feel like I can’t give up yet."
    "Because even if this date has been equal parts confusing and exhausting, I’m enticed by the idea of a future where the Tsuneyo {i}I{/i} know is by my side."
    "And she becomes a little less real once parts of her start being stripped away."

    "It’s been six hours since we’ve gotten here...and we’ve done nothing but walk around and eat."
    "And talk, of course...but that’s a natural side effect of just being in the presence of one another."
    "I have tried on countless occasions to explain to Tsuneyo that those thoughts she had about the repetitiveness of time are not without merit, but she has not heard me even once."
    "And I have given up on trying."
    "I didn’t think I would. And while I’m no stranger to giving up, it’s not as if I approach every obstacle in my path without at least some interest in clearing it."
    "But there comes a time when you need to accept you’re fighting a losing battle...and it’s hard to win any battle at all when you’re not even sure who or what you’re fighting against."
    "I’m sure there’s a Tsuneyo out there who {i}will{/i} come to understand that the world is not what it seems."
    "But this one isn’t it."
    "And that makes everything feel so...inauthentic."

    t "How strange. Up until now, I believed there was no limit to the amount of noodle-based dishes I could consume...but I am struggling to so much as touch this plate."
    s "It’s okay to give up, you know. I was actually just thinking that. "
    t "I refuse. Someone made this dish and it is my duty as a fellow warrior to slay it. If you or anyone else had ever left behind something that I took the time to make for you, I would never forget it."
    s "I have a confession to make."
    t "I hope it is not a romantic one. I am in no shape to love right now."
    s "The last time I had you box up the remainder of my food at Tojo Ramen, I never wound up finishing it when I got home."
    t "You bastard. How dare you."
    s "It’s the truth."
    t "It is insulting enough that you would have me pack the remainder of your food, but to spit in my face and tell me you did it for nothing more than recreation is horrible by even your standards."
    s "Do you know what else is horrible?"
    t "Spiders. They’re second only to you on my list right now."
    s "No, hold on. I was about to say something really smooth."
    t "I apologize. Please try again."
    s "Do you know what else is horrible?"
    t "Spiders. They-"
    s "Tsuneyo, come on."
    t "Fine. One more time. And I will keep my mouth shut even if I {i}do{/i} have an immense distaste for arachnids."
    s "Then...do you know what else is horrible?"
    t "..."
    s "That this day has to end."
    t "That would have been very endearing if you were not currently my least favorite creature in the entire world."
    s "I try."
    t "It doesn’t have to end yet, though."
    s "It kind of does. The park is closing. So unless you plan on coming back to my house with me, I can’t see how-"

    scene unexpecteddate24

    t "That."
    s "The ferris wheel? What about it?"
    t "Do you think we could make it in time if we ran?"
    t "It’s slow enough that the two of us would be able to ride it without fear. And I would be lying if I said I was not slightly interested."
    s "Are you sure you want to?"
    t "Is there a reason we should not?"
    s "You’d be trapped in a slow moving, compact box with me for an extended period of time. Aren’t you worried I’ll try something?"

    scene unexpecteddate25
    with dissolve

    t "Are you not worried of what {i}I{/i} could do to you? You may be larger, but I firmly believe that I would come out victorious in the event of a battle."
    s "I’m ashamed to say it, but I think you probably would as well."
    t "Then let’s go. If we delay any further, we’ll miss our chance..."
    t "And this may be the last date we ever have."

    t "It is my understanding that many dates come with the complete lack of romantic contact. What prevents us from going on a date like that other than your inability to provide a straight answer?"
    s "I think the idea of dates {i}like that{/i} is the hope that they will one day lead to something more."

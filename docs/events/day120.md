    "I find myself walking home after yet another uneventful day at[school]."
    "And I say ‘uneventful’ in the loosest possible sense because Yumi actually showed up today, and that’s always something to celebrate."
    "Well, it’s something to celebrate when I’m not forcing her to stop insulting the other girls in order to make up for her...apparent inferiority complex?"
    "Now that I think of it, I don’t really understand why Yumi is so mean to everyone to begin with."
    "It {i}has{/i} to be an inferiority complex, right? That’s normally how the bully trope goes."
    "And God forbid these girls start subverting their character tropes. That would really throw me off."

    with dissolve

    r "Huh? Cause you’re tall and you’re a guy. I thought it was pretty obvious."
    s "Well...I mean, yes. But you’ve never called me that before. It makes it sound like we don’t know each other."
    r "Who cares? The only other person around is Sana and I’m pretty sure she knows that we’re cool."

    "Once Rin points that out, I realize that the streets {i}are{/i} eerily empty today. I wonder if it’s because of the heat?"
    "…"
    "No, that can’t be it. Both of them are wearing long sleeves. "
    "Where the hell is everyone?"

    s "Well, either way, go back to calling me Sensei. I don’t want to be “tall guy” anymore."

    if cafe25 == True:
        s "It’s bad enough that Kaori is already calling me Hamburger Man. Another nickname would be too much to keep track of."

        r "Uh...no."

        r "Uhh, I don’t know?...Average-height Lass? "
        sa "That’s...not a very good superhero name..."

    s "So, nicknames aside, I’m glad to see you two are getting along."

    scene girlsagain6
    with dissolve

    r "Dude, same! Sana and I have like, a zillion things in common. Who would have ever thought?"
    s "Wow. How close have the two of you gotten over the last few weeks?"
    sa "Rin let me touch her skulls."
    r "I did! No one’s ever asked to do that before."
    r "Even Futaba is like “Umm...can you turn those away when I’m trying to sleep?”"
    r "I basically have to give her a friggin’ pep talk every night. But Sana here just walked up to them and started doing the Hamlet thing."
    s "She...spontaneously recited a monologue to a skull?"

    scene girlsagain7
    with dissolve

    sa "Um...that part...didn’t happen."
    sa "I kind of just...held one for a little while."
    r "Oh, right. Totally misremembered that scene in my head. Whoops."
    r "But yeah, Sana’s basically like a little sister to me already. Which is cool cause I’m kind of like Futaba’s little sister."
    r "So the three of us are gonna form a sisterhood and start sharing pants or however that one story goes."

    "I glance at Sana, who seems content but still struggling to keep up with Rin’s, uhh, {i}pace{/i}."
    "Having known the two of them for some time now, I can see how they’d get along so well, but I can also see how it might be difficult at times."
    "Rin is adept when it comes to communicating with people, but lacks a filter."
    "And, of course, Sana is the complete opposite."
    "But either way, I’m glad to see the two of them spending time together like this."

    r "Oooooh, I totally forgot you two were even roommates! I don’t really talk to Ayane that much."
    r "What’s she like? That sword she brought in the other day was really cool. Do you think she’d let me hold it?"
    sa "Um...I don’t really know if she’d let you hold it...but she’s really nice."
    sa "She was willing to get to know me when nobody else was so...I’m really thankful for her."

    scene girlsagain10
    with dissolve

    r "Dude, {i}everyone{/i} is willing to get to know you. You’ve just gotta put in some of the work."
    r "People are like, totally weird and annoying and stuff, but no one is gonna see {i}you{/i} and be like “Nahh I’m good.”"
    r "You’ve just gotta do the thing and then stuff will happen."
    sa "…"

    scene girlsagain11

    sa "Umm...can you..."
    s "You need me to translate for you?"
    sa "Yes please..."

    scene girlsagain12
    with dissolve

    r "Wait...did I say something weird? What part about that was confusing?"
    s "I think Rin is trying to say that everyone would be open to being your friend because of how cute you are."

    scene girlsagain13
    with dissolve

    r "Yeah! That! That’s much easier to understand than how I put it!"
    sa "Wh-what?! "

    scene girlsagain14
    with dissolve

    r "Sana, you probably don’t realize this since you’re like, super shy and awkward and stuff, but you’re low-key one of the cutest girls in the entire world."
    r "Kind of like a cross between a lost kitten and an excited puppy. Oh- and like, four baby seals thrown into the mix."

    scene girlsagain15
    with dissolve

    sa "That’s too many things! I’m just a girl!"
    r "Yeah but girls are the best! There’s a reason I’m so into-"

    r "{i}Pah...{/i}"

    "Rin suddenly deflates as she narrowly avoids revealing to her new friend that she’s [[probably] sexually attracted to her."
    "I can only imagine how finding out something like that would impact Sana, who I’m pretty sure is at least six-hundred years away from becoming curious about romance."

    sa "Sensei...I, um..."
    sa "I want to...thank you again for...all of your help."
    sa "Without you...I wouldn’t be able to-"
    s "Don’t thank me yet, Sana. Your character arc has barely even started."

    scene girlsagain20
    with dissolve

    sa "My...what?"
    s "I told you in class the other day. We can’t call it quits on your progression until you’re friends with everyone."
    s "Don’t make it sound like doubling your previous count of just one friend is enough to satisfy me."
    sa "But two is already hard! Look at Rin! She deflated and I don’t even understand why!"
    s "That...is something you’ll have to find out later. I’m not really able to disclose other peoples’ secrets to you."

    scene girlsagain21
    with dissolve

    r "Secrets?! I don’t have any secrets! You take that back, Tall Guy!"
    s "How am I back to that nickname already? I thought we were done with this."
    r "We were until you decided to hint at my...thoughts to Sana! She is too pure for such things!"

    sa "Um...excuse me..."
    sa "I don’t really...understand what’s going on right now..."

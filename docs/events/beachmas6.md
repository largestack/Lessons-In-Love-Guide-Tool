    ay "Is something wrong, Yasu? It’s not like you to just wander into a conversation two people are having and just- actually, no. That is exactly like you."
    ay "But that doesn’t make it any less concerning."
    ya "What should be concerning to everyone is the alluring fragrance of a nearby angel and the wonderful luck it will bring to all of us."
    sa "Umm..."
    ay "Don’t get me wrong, I do think Sana smells nice. But I’m not really sure if I’d call it good luck. "
    ay "The angel part is spot on, though. Isn't she great?"
    ya "It is not {i}her{/i} that smells like heaven. The scent comes from the thoughts she thinks and the things that she will see behind closed doors."
    sa "Yasu...you’re scaring me..."
    ya "How do you hold it all in? Does it not eat away it you? Does it not make you {i}sweat?{/i}"

    sa "A...Ayane? Can you...maybe do something?..."
    ay "I’m not really sure what I {i}can{/i} do. I’ve tried Touka’s “boop” tactic on Yasu seven times and it’s had no effect. I’m pretty sure the only one who can actually influence her behavior is Touka."
    ya "That is simply not true. All of my actions are predetermined by God Almighty and the only one who can puppet this fragile body of mine is Him."
    ya "But I am not the sole vessel here being puppeted. Isn’t that right, Sana?"

    scene iosawsomethingtoo3
    with dissolve

    sa "I...really don’t...have any idea what...you’re talking about..."
    ya "Then why is the sound of your heartbeat resonating throughout my blessed ears? Why does the blood pool in your face?"
    ya "You know these answers, yet conceal them as you’re afraid of the way you feel."

    sa "Ayane! Help!"
    ay "Yasu, maybe it would be best if you ran along and looked for Touka? I think Sana would rather be alone right now."
    ya "Yes. I also think Sana should be {i}alone{/i} right now. For it is only in the deepest bouts of loneliness that we unmask ourselves. And I can feel her desire to tear that mask off {i}dripping{/i} from her tiny body."
    sa "D-Desire doesn’t...drip! It doesn’t do anything! It’s...invisible!"
    ya "Maybe to everyone else. But to some of us, it’s fully tangible."
    ya "And if it was not a sin to do so, I could reach out...and curl my tiny fingers around your {i}desires{/i} right now."
    ya "Why are you still here?"
    sa "Because I’m scared and I can’t move!"
    ay "Yasu...take a hint, please..."
    ya "{i}Do it.{/i} "

    ya "Hm? Scared who away?"
    ya "Where is Touka? And why do my legs feel all wobbly?"
    ay "You know what...forget it. I hope your angel point was worth it."
    ay "Now, if you’ll excuse me, I should go find the girl you just traumatized and-"
    ya "No. We should stay here and talk instead. Tragedy is sure to come if we do not."
    ay "Tragedy?"
    ya "We will all be sent back if He remains unsatisfied."

    s "Nothing really. I thought it was Ami time, but she kind of just vanished and I have no idea where she went."

    with dissolve

    u "What’s Ami time? Is that what it’s called when she grinds out love points and stretches that number one harem lead of hers into an even {i}bigger{/i} lead?"
    s "Why is Ami still in first place? There has to be someone I’m not related to that would make a better more socially acceptable candidate for that."
    u "Beats me, but it sounds like she’s the only one who’s got a dedicated time named after her. Can’t remember the last instance of “Uta time.”"
    s "I will gladly spend the rest of my life in Uta time. You’re the only one preventing that from happening."

    scene iosawsomethingtoo15
    with dissolve

    u "Oh, stop...you’d get bored of me sooner than ya think...then it would be right back to the drawing board."
    u "Plus, long distance calls can get pretty expensive this time of year and there’d just be {i}way{/i} too many calls I’d need to make if we really {i}did{/i} do something like that."
    s "If I need to pay one more phone bill to get into your pants, I will gladly do it."

    scene iosawsomethingtoo16
    with dissolve

    u "Hahah...hah...and yet you returned my underwear..."
    s "Did you...want me to keep them?"

    scene iosawsomethingtoo17
    with dissolve

    u "Wha- obviously not! I just figured that the {i}real{/i} move if you were so dead set on perving out on me would be to keep them to yourself and never tell me about it!"
    u "Getting something like that back from a guy is kind of insulting, you know!"
    s "Sorry. I didn’t realize how experienced you were when it came to lending out underwear."

    scene iosawsomethingtoo18
    with dissolve

    u "That, uhh..."
    u "It kinda stings a little when you put it that way, you know?..."
    s "I didn’t mean anything by it, Uta."

    "Nor did I acknowledge the possibility that my throwaway joke would have been an actual possibility for her, but...I guess there’s still a lot I don’t know about her past."
    "And a lot I’m in no rush to find out."

    scene iosawsomethingtoo19
    with dissolve

    u "Yeah! I...I know! I guess I’m just still kind of embarrassed about the whole...you carrying my underwear home with you and...and then washing them and then...bringing them back to my dorm...thing."

    "Not washing them wasn’t really an option after the mileage I got out of them."

    u "But uhh...back to things that...{i}don’t{/i} make me feel all horrible inside...Christmas! Right?!"
    s "Right...Christmas."

    "I do my best to throw Uta a life raft and abandon further embarrassing her even when I know that continuing to press her on the matter could land her in my arms by the end of the night."
    "Because, as enticing as it is to contemplate the idea of a fun-sized, yet {i}surprisingly{/i} well-endowed, maid bouncing up and down on my dick in the ekiben position, I have grown past that."
    "And I now find myself, more often than not, thinking about how the recipient of my manhood will feel for a second or two before ultimately abandoning that idea altogether and continuing to press them anyway."

    s "..."

    "Ugh..."
    "I miss the me who didn’t actually care about these girls."

    s "As excited as I can be, I guess. Christmas isn’t really my kind of holiday."

    scene iosawsomethingtoo21
    with dissolve

    u "What {i}is{/i} your kind of holiday, then? You seemed pretty energetic during Halloween. Is that it?"
    s "Probably. Crazy to believe that was nearly two months ago, right?"

    scene iosawsomethingtoo22
    with dissolve

    u "You think so? Seems about right to me. But all things considered, I guess stuff {i}has{/i} been kinda anticlimactic since then."
    u "Feel like you haven’t even really come to the maid cafe at all either. Somethin’ going on at home that you wanna talk about? Does it have to do with Ami time?"
    s "Not unless Ami has the ability to manipulate time at will and decided she didn’t want to wait any longer for Christmas. Which, you know...fair."

    scene iosawsomethingtoo21
    with dissolve

    u "I’ll say. Christmas is fun enough on its own, but pairing it with our yearly beach trip? I ain’t had this much fun since the first Dorm Wars."
    s "Did you not enjoy the second one?"
    u "No, I had fun. And this'll probably sound a little ironic, but...it was just kind of exhausting not being able to act like myself the full time, you know?"
    u "Feel like even Io had more fun than me and I’m not even sure if Io realizes that fun {i}exists{/i} yet."
    s "Yeah, where is she by the way? I’m surprised you two aren’t together."

    scene iosawsomethingtoo22
    with dissolve

    u "Io? She wandered off a little while ago to look for shade or somethin’ since she didn’t want to go swimming with me."
    s "That sounds about right. You sure you don’t want to go looking for her, though? I wouldn’t mind helping. It’s not like I have anything else going on."

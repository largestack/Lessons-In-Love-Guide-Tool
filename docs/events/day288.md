    "The second girl, on the other hand, is the one we still can’t figure anything out for."
    "Her previous teachers wouldn’t even speak with me, which makes me worry that it’s going to be another Yumi-type situation."
    "But hey, if it is, I guess that will keep one more desk free most days. So I’m fine with it in that regard."

    no "Oh dear. We’re not getting in trouble for loitering, are we?"

    scene dormeightfourhall2
    with dissolve

    o "Yumi? Is there someone in our class with that name?"
    r "Barely. She just shows up every once in a while to say mean things to Futaba and then leave."

    s "Yeah. She’s Yumi. She’ll be fine."

    s "I have to say, I’m pretty sure a fight wouldn’t exactly go in your favor."

    o "I mean, I guess it doesn’t really matter either way."
    o "It’s not like you’d have a hard time getting one or anything. You’re a pretty attractive guy."

    s "That is probably for the best."
    no "On a completely serious note, I do think you should stop by soon."
    no "The four of us will be having a little move-in party, and it would be nice to have someone to move all of our belongings into the room while we drink tea and listen to sad music."
    s "You know, for a second, I thought I was {i}actually{/i} being invited to party."
    r "You are. Just as a mover and not a partygoer."
    r "I’ll save you some tea, though. "
    o "You can chill too, if you want. I don’t mind helping you move everything."
    o "I’ve got a lot of heavier stuff so I’d feel really bad if you were just handling all of it on your own."

    f "In fact, I’ve never thought that even once!"
    no "Boy am I glad I was only vegetarian for a few months."
    r "What’s wrong with being meat? Everybody likes meat."
    o "Not Noriko. She’s still going strong on her diet from what I hear."
    s "I can assure you that if I were meat, Noriko would break her diet immediately."

    r "Have you really known her for that long, Sensei?"
    f "I’m...a little more confused about how Maya reacted."
    f "I could have sworn the two of you didn’t like each other very much."
    o "Ready to sit around and pretend we understand what’s going on, Nodoka?"
    no "It smells like drama, Otoha. "
    no "Quick, let’s use this opportunity to grab our notebooks and jot down ideas for our next poems."
    s "Don’t worry about how Maya reacted and don’t worry about how long I’ve known Noriko for."
    s "Neither of those things really concern either of you."
    r "Sure they do! You’re a big part of our lives, Sensei. Do you have any idea how often we talk about you?"
    r "Like, at least twice a week."
    s "The way you started that made it sound like it was going to be a lot more..."
    r "I said “at least!” Sometimes it {i}is{/i} more."

    scene dormeightfourhall17
    with dissolve

    f "I..."
    f "I suppose I can look past Maya’s reaction since...it’s the only time I’ve ever seen her do anything like that..."
    f "It...did stick out, though."
    f "So...I wouldn’t be surprised if someone else made a bigger deal out of it."
    o "I feel like we missed something really juicy."
    o "But I guess if anyone could make things juicy, it's Noriko."
    o "She carries this knife thing around and, this one time, she sliced her leg open so bad that there was blood literally everywhere."
    o "She didn’t even think it was a big deal, though, and just kinda laughed it off. Girl is crazy."
    o "Good crazy, though. She’s fun."
    s "Yeah, nothing says fun like...blood everywhere. "
    r "Point is, Sensei, you know you can talk to us if you ever need an extra set of ears."
    r "And we’ve got like, eight whole ears at the end of this hallway for you right now."
    no "It {i}does{/i} seem slightly unfair that you’re the sole individual designated to counseling all of us."
    o "Yeah, so I guess I’d be down to listen too if you want to open up to somebody you just met and have talked to like, less than five times."
    s "Is this an intervention or something? Why did everyone suddenly start offering me help?"
    r "Just seems like things are gettin’ a little crazy for you. It would do you some good to take a load off in Otoha and Nodoka’s room sometime."

    with dissolve

    f "Rin...you probably shouldn’t invite someone to someone else’s room..."
    r "Didn’t we already decide it was okay, though?"
    f "Still...it’s the...principle of actually doing that."
    o "Screw it, yeah. Come chill with us."
    o "If you think it’s fun hanging out and listening to music with a bunch of [teenage]girls, be our guest."
    no "Literally. Become our guest."
    no "Simply arriving will net you a total of twenty more Nodoka points."

    with dissolve

    o "Nodoka points? What’s a Nodoka point? "
    o "How many do I have and what can I do with them?"
    no "It’s a currency I created up specifically for Sensei. "
    no "I use them to determine how far along in our relationship we are."

    if bonus == True:
        f "That...kind of makes it sound like you have...ulterior motives."
    else:
        f "Are you...trying to get to a certain stage or something?..."

    no "Not at all. Everyone has a secret currency for everyone else whether they’re aware of it or not."
    no "I’m sure that all of you have been slowly building up points with him in your heads as you experience new things together."
    no "I was just smart enough to assign a separate numeric value to mine so I can keep better track of them."
    s "You’re making this impromptu point system sound a lot more logical than I’m sure it actually is."
    no "We’ll see if you’ll still be saying that when you go to cash them in some day."

    o "Welp, I’m lost. But if you want your Nodoka points or whatever, feel free to drop by. "
    o "I’m probably going to be spending my free time during the weekends just...scoping out new parks to play in or something if you ever want to come hang out for some reason."
    no "And I’ll be somewhere with many books. Doing book things."
    s "Aren’t you supposed to be a writer? Where’s your clever word usage?"

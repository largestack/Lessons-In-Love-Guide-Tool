    "Nodoka and I make our way across town after[school] in hopes of meeting up with Otoha."
    "Rin was supposed to come as well, but she apparently forgot that she had a doctor's appointment today."
    "I’m fine with this of course, as it means I’ll finally get to be alone with Nodoka. "
    "But I guess I’m mildly surprised by how open she was to this instead of just deciding to postpone the excursion."
    "Then again, Uta also did something similar shortly after transferring in."
    "And as much as I want to say that those two are just looking to get closer to me, the logical thing to think would be that they’re going out on a limb for their friends."
    "{i}Or{/i} that they’re going out on a limb for their friends but also want to be alone with me."
    "This is the most exciting answer, so it is the one that I will go with."

    no "Don’t you think you should be wearing something a little warmer given the weather, Sensei?"
    s "I’ll have you know this is the thickest T-shirt money can buy at one very specific store in one very specific location."
    s "And shouldn’t you be drinking something a little warmer than bottled water?"
    no "Probably. But this is what I have, so this is what I’ll drink."
    no "Would you like a sip?"
    s "I’m good, thanks."
    no "Afraid to share an indirect kiss with someone you just met?"

    if bonus == True:
        s "No. I’m just not some maniac who walks around in the snow drinking something that will likely be frozen before we even make it back home."
    else:
        s "No, I'm just afraid of cooties. I'm not some maniac who would just risk his life for a sip of water."

    scene nodokaotohapark2
    with dissolve

    no "Of course you’re not a maniac. You’re a completely normal adult accompanying a [young_girl] miles away to meet up with another [young_girl] and potentially kidnap her."
    s "Well it definitely doesn’t sound normal when you put it like that."

    scene nodokaotohapark3
    with dissolve

    no "It doesn’t need to sound normal. "
    no "In fact, nothing needs to sound normal."
    no "The most exciting parts of life are the ones you wouldn’t possibly be able to recreate even if you tried your hardest."
    no "This is the first and last time the two of us will ever come to this park in the snow to pull someone out of the pits of despair."
    no "I think that makes today a beautiful day."
    s "Yeah, but you can be that specific about anything and make it sound more special than it actually is."

    scene nodokaotohapark4
    with dissolve

    no "That’s my job, Sensei."
    no "Otoha’s as well."
    no "We’re just two cute girls who find interesting ways to rearrange words or sounds, and yet we’re regarded as geniuses by many of our peers."
    no "It’s rather silly, I think. How people are quicker to give up and praise others rather than attempt to obtain said praise on their own."
    s "Oh, okay. So you’re one of those cool geniuses who pretends to {i}not{/i} be a genius because being praised is troublesome. "
    no "Perhaps. Or perhaps I just want people to view me for who I really am rather than what I write."
    s "Who are you then?"
    no "I don’t know."
    no "The [incest]uous haiku girl, I suppose?"
    s "I feel like you have access to a lot more words that probably would have been better there."
    no "And yet I chose the ones I liked the most instead of choosing the ones you expected. Bam, genius."
    s "You’re weird."
    no "So are you."

    if bonus == True:
        no "Want to make out?"
    else:
        no "Wanna take a quick hug break?"

    s "Sure. Aren’t we on a mission, though?"
    no "I wasn’t being serious."
    s "Oh."
    s "Well shit."

    scene nodokaotohapark5
    with dissolve

    no "On the bright side, this confirms that you really {i}weren’t{/i} afraid of the indirect kiss, though. "

    if bonus == False:
        s "Right. It was the cooties. I already told you that."

    no "I award you five more Nodoka points for your bravery, which brings you to a total of ten."

    if bonus == True:
        s "How many more until we can make out?"
    else:
        s "How many more until the hug happens?"

    no "Five thousand. "

    if bonus == True:
        s "That is way too many points. You better be really good at making out."
    else:
        s "That is such an expensive hug."

    scene nodokaotohapark6
    with dissolve

    no "I think it's a fair amount of points."
    no "If you’re earning an average of five per day, you’re currently on pace to finish just under three years from now."

    if bonus == True:
        no "It would probably be safer to engage in a tryst with a senior anyway. Chin up, Sensei."

    s "You’re so weird."
    no "I suppose I am."
    no "But I’m more suited to the role of a matchmaker anyway."
    no "Or perhaps a seer. "
    no "To observe the dynamics between others. "
    no "To write them down. "

    if bonus == True:
        no "And to get really raunchy with all of the explicit details because sex sells."
    else:
        no "And to lick the mirror while no one is watching and see if I can taste my own tongue."

    no "Such is the mission of the [incest]uous haiku girl."
    s "…"
    no "…"
    s "So anyway, Otoha."

    scene nodokaotohapark7
    with dissolve

    no "Right, Otoha."
    no "We’re not far from her usual spot. "
    no "She’s extremely predictable, unlike yours truly."
    s "I’m sure you’ll wind up being plenty predictable soon enough."
    s "I’m normally pretty good at figuring people out, I think."
    no "I suppose we’ll just have to wait and find out how true that is, then."
    no "I’m not opposed to the idea of someone being able to truly understand me when no one really has before."
    no "I don’t know how fond I am of that person being my teacher, but I suppose it would make my life more like something out of a novel."
    no "And just think of how many Nodoka points you could earn if you started {i}really{/i} getting it."

    if bonus == True:
        s "We’ll be making out in no time at all."
        no "Tack an extra thousand points on and I might let you play with my breasts."
    else:
        s "We will be hugging in no time at all."
        no "Tack an extra thousand points and I might even trade glasses with you for a day."

    s "Might? That doesn’t sound like a good use of my Nodoka points. I need a manufacturer guarantee."
    no "Apologies, but providing guarantees and refunds goes against company policy. "
    no "All points are to be used at the sole discretion of the consumer and I will not be held liable for any problems that may occur as a result of their misuse."
    s "I hope your currency tanks and you’re forced to accept real money instead."
    no "Do you think you could afford me if that happens?"
    s "How much do you think you’re worth?"
    no "I’ll tell you exactly how much I think I’d be worth for three hundred Nodoka points."
    s "…"

    "I watch them toss coins into a fountain in the center, wondering what it is they could be wishing for."
    "And then I start to wonder what I would wish for if I had any coins on me."

    o "Uhh...first time as in..."

    if bonus == True:
        no "I understand that it might not sound exciting simply {i}being{/i} there, so I’m offering to share his body with you. "
        no "But only this once. After that, you can continue to watch, but-"
    else:
        no "First game, obviously."
        s "Yeah. Come on, Otoha. What else would that have meant?"
        no "It is very important to both of us that you are there to see it."

    scene nodokaotohapark11
    with dissolve

    o "She’s joking, right?"

    if bonus == True:
        o "Because it would be messed up if you came all the way over here to invite me to some...weird threesome."
    else:
        o "Because Nodoka already knows my conservatorship has a no bocci ball clause."

    s "I’ll actually let Nodoka explain why we’re here since I don’t really get it yet."

    scene nodokaotohapark12
    with dissolve

    no "Oh, look. A bird that I will proceed to stare at for the next ten minutes as you rescue this one from its cage."
    no "Have fun explaining everything, Sensei."
    o "It would probably be easier for you to just tell me. We’re not getting anything out of Nodoka."
    s "I see that..."
    s "This would have been a lot easier if Rin came."
    o "She had a doctor’s appointment or something today, right?"
    s "Yeah. I guess that means you two are still talking regularly?"

    scene nodokaotohapark13
    with dissolve

    o "Regularly is kind of an understatement when she messages me like ten thousand times a day."
    s "Yeah...she can get like that."
    s "It doesn’t look like you mind, though."
    o "Nah. I thought it was a little weird at first, but she’s grown on me."
    o "Kinda like a...puppy waiting for its master to come home and-"

    scene nodokaotohapark14
    with dissolve

    o "Ew. That probably made me sound really weird, didn’t it?"
    s "I’m pretty sure it would make her the happiest girl in the world."

    scene nodokaotohapark15
    with dissolve

    o "Hahah...yeah. Probably."
    o "I’m sure you didn’t come all the way here just to talk about Rin, though. Right?"
    o "Is this about transferring?"
    s "Oh, so you {i}do{/i} know what’s going on."
    o "Well considering Nodoka and Rin have both been bothering me about it constantly, yeah. I think I get what's going on now."
    o "I don’t really know, though."
    o "I was doing okay in my last[school], but I’m not that great with change. And one wrong move could like, really mess up what I have going for me right now."
    s "What do you have going for you right now?"
    o "I don’t know. Freedom, I guess?"
    s "I don’t know if I’d call having your spare time entirely dependent on whether or not you get good grades “freedom.”"

    scene nodokaotohapark16
    with dissolve

    o "Well, yeah...But it makes sense."
    o "Shouldn’t a student’s primary objective be getting good grades or whatever? "
    o "And like, if your grades suck, obviously you should be spending less time doing what you want to do and studying instead."
    s "Or, alternatively, what if you were spending {i}all{/i} of your time doing the things you want to do?"
    o "You’d...probably fail and get held back. "
    o "What are you getting at?"
    s "Transfer into my class and you can do whatever you want, whenever you want."

    scene nodokaotohapark17
    with dissolve

    o "Wait! That makes it sound like you’re teaching some like, music class or something. That's not true, is it?"

    if bonus == True:
        s "The real answer is a lot less...interesting."
        s "I just mean that I hate teaching, so I give everyone straight A’s so I don’t have to do anything."
        o "Is that even legal?"
        s "Who knows?"
        s "But the point is, I’d be willing to do that same exact thing for you since you are the most highly-requested student I’ve had so far."
    else:
        s "I will teach anything and everything. If you require a music teacher, I will learn music right away."
        o "Oh. Uhh, well, that's not really-"
        s "I'll do it. I swear."
        o "..."
        s "I mean it. You're the most highly requested student I've had thus far. And if your presence will make the others happy, I should do my best to make it happen."

    o "But only Nodoka and Rin have requested me."
    s "Noriko Nakayama as well. All three of them bombarded me in my office after[school] yesterday asking me to do this."

    scene nodokaotohapark18
    with dissolve

    o "Noriko is there too?! That’s crazy!"
    o "How the hell did you wind up with three of the coolest people I know?"
    s "Probably because I’m the coolest teacher you know."
    o "Hahahaha! No, really though. How’d you do it?"
    s "…"
    s "Am I..."
    s "Am I not cool to you?"
    o "…"

    scene nodokaotohapark19
    with dissolve

    o "Ah, wait! I wasn’t trying to be mean! I just thought you were joking!"
    s "Maybe it’s better if you don’t transfer in after all..."
    o "No no no no, hold on! I’d {i}love{/i} to get out of my house, I just don’t really know if it would be a good idea."

    scene nodokaotohapark20
    with dissolve

    o "It just sounds a little too good to be true, you know?"
    o "Like, I don’t want to go through the effort of talking my parents into letting me transfer and...having to leave again if I can’t keep up."
    o "Plus, getting them to let me move into a dorm would be like, a completely different conversation."
    o "It’s just way too much to do for something that I can't guarantee will actually work out."
    s "Sounds to me like someone is scared."
    o "Kind of, yeah. I’m not really hiding that."
    o "It would be awesome if I could spend more time practicing my singing and stuff but like, some people just aren’t meant to do that."
    s "Do you not believe the thing about getting A’s for doing literally nothing?"

    scene nodokaotohapark10
    with dissolve

    o "Not really. "
    o "Nodoka, is that true?"
    no "I don’t know. I haven’t transferred in yet."
    s "How is saying that helping you accomplish your goal? Just lie to her."
    no "I don’t need to. I already know what she’s going to do."
    no "You’re tired of staying at home, aren’t you?"
    no "I know what it’s like to feel trapped. You can’t create in an environment like that."
    no "The best thing for you is to truly experience freedom. And to do that, you must escape the cage."
    no "Mend your broken wings and fly higher than you’ve ever flown before."

        o "Uhh...no..."

    o "I just..."
    o "You’re really sure about the A’s thing, right?"
    o "Because if you can like, {i}really{/i} promise me that, I can probably make a deal with them."

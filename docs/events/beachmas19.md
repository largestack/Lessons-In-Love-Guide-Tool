    "Carry on my name; as if it is your own."
    "If I can live inside of you, we’ll never be alone."
    "So when I’m gone, remove your heart.\nI’ll give you mine instead."
    "And when that’s done, remove your brain-\nLet {i}me{/i} into your head."
    "The world won’t understand us- that’s why we lock the doors."
    "That’s why we board the windows — lay our blankets on the floor."
    "The softest of materials, half a step from what’s ethereal,\nMy love for you’s bacterial! I’ve never wanted more!"
    "Than to be the one you see at night."
    "You’re my Edgar.\nLove, Lenore."

    "Words!"
    "Combinations of lines! Compressed into strands with the right amount of pressure and skill!"
    "Compact meanings into ropes! Ropes that we can use to bind what we are afraid of losing! To keep it all in one place!"
    "Untie me! Remove the bindings in my head and recreate what once lived outside of it!"
    "Amalgamation of unwanted flesh! Patchwork carbon being! You are the me who should not be me!"
    "{b}YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING!{/b}"

    "But I am."
    "And I am more sentient than ever."
    "For I have discovered what is important in a way that does not thrust me into the darkest pits of this unwanted mind."
    "I have LIVED through the end of days and am prepared to face the demons I create or she creates or it creates or demons as a whole."
    "I am prepared to fight for what I cherish in the face of the holy and will sodomize the omnipowerful rectum of any intervening god with my dramatically impressive cock."

    "But she does."
    "And looking at her makes me feel normal again."

    m "Let’s get one thing straight. The only reason I wanted to see you was so I could complain about your inadequacies as a reset partner. "
    s "Cool. Merry Christmas to you as well."
    m "Where were you?"
    s "Why does it matter?"
    m "Because everyone is vying for your attention tonight and it’s too suspicious to keep wandering off like that without saying anything to anyone."
    s "Right. So I’m assuming that means you informed the rest of the class that you were going to be contacting me when you {i}also{/i} wandered off?"

    scene fireflies3
    with dissolve

    m "Don’t be ridiculous. The only person who has an inkling of what I’m doing out here is Ayane and that is certainly not because I {i}told{/i} her."
    s "Then why do you think she knows?"
    m "Because she sent me a text message telling me to tell you she says “Hi.”"
    s "Oh. Tell her I say “Hi” as well, then."
    m "Tell her yourself. You’re essentially inseparable at this point, aren’t you?"
    s "By the universe’s definition, yes. But that would just mean you and I are inseparable as well."
    m "Don’t remind me."
    s "We’re inseparable."

    scene fireflies4
    with dissolve

    m "Just as bad at following directions as ever, I see."
    s "The ones I disagree with, yes. But I do often follow the rules that benefit me in some way."
    m "That doesn’t make you good at following directions, it makes you a narcissist. But you’re pretty horrible at that as well since you’re always walking around feeling sorry for yourself."
    m "You know you-"
    s "I could have had sex with Noriko tonight."

    scene fireflies5
    with dissolve

    m "Oh, how nice. Thank you for randomly reminding me that she’s a desperate cunt who-"
    s "I left because you texted me."

    scene fireflies6
    with dissolve

    m "You...what?"
    s "I’m just saying that if you’re going to keep rambling on about how much I suck, that you should at least know that."
    m "..."
    s "Does choosing a sexless meeting with you over deflowering your rival earn me any points? And if so, can I cash some of them in for a chance to sit next to you? My legs are tired."
    m "..."
    s "..."

    scene fireflies7
    with dissolve

    m "Fine. Sit."
    m "But I’m not going to thank you for not being an insatiable predator for the first time in your-"

    scene black
    with dissolve

    s "Thanks. Move over."
    m "You fucking..."

    scene fireflies8
    with dissolve

    m "Where did this sudden...sassy attitude come from? I ask you to come see me {i}one time{/i} and now you’re treating me like I can’t live without you?"
    s "You got me."
    m "I should have just stayed at the inn."
    s "Probably."
    s "That would have made Noriko a lot happier, at least."

    scene fireflies9
    with dissolve

    m "You’re disgusting."
    s "I know. "
    m "..."
    s "..."
    m "But..."
    m "I’m thankful you did come."
    m "And I was lying when I said the only reason was to call you out for your inadequacies as a reset partner."
    s "I know."

    scene fireflies10
    with dissolve

    m "I guess that makes this the second Christmas in a row where you were late for a meeting with me because of her."
    s "Except my actual meeting with you was technically yesterday and I had no idea this one was even happening until I was already on my way."
    m "Your initial reaction to realizing you abandoned me should have been to reschedule."
    s "I’ve had plans with Noriko since yesterday."
    m "Oh, okay. So you just remembered your meeting with {i}her{/i} and not me. I get it now."
    s "I know how it sounds. But last night was kind of...weird. And you could have just texted me to remind me anyway. "
    m "What made last night any weirder than any {i}other{/i} night as the man with the world’s most active libido?"
    s "Probably the part where I passed out on the beach for no reason whatsoever. Or the part where Tsuneyo might subconsciously know that the world is resetting."

    scene fireflies11
    with dissolve

    m "Wait, what? Why do you say that?"
    s "She said something about feeling like everything is going in circles sometimes."
    m "That’s...not really enough to go off of."
    s "Maybe not on its own. But Yumi seemed to be a little confused as well...and couldn’t even remember anything that happened between Halloween and now."
    m "Were you...actually trying to figure things out instead of just preying upon our class the last two nights?"
    s "Unexpected side effect."
    m "But why...those two? I didn’t think you were particularly close with either of them."
    s "I’m not. But it’s not like I surveyed every single girl in class about their knowledge of the last two months. It’s just stuff I figured out while {i}preying upon the class.{/i}"

    scene fireflies12
    with dissolve

    m "Huh..."
    m "You {i}were{/i} talking to Yumi during the jump from the Dorm Wars to Christmas, so...I guess it would make sense for her to be at least slightly confused about that?"
    m "Nothing similar has ever happened before, so it might be something worth looking into. "
    s "Got it. I’ll be sure to get her pregnant before the next reset comes so we can really start pressing her about it."

    scene fireflies13
    with dissolve

    m "Or, you can {i}not{/i} get anyone pregnant because it’s utterly repulsive and babies are evil."
    s "You and Ayane really couldn’t be any further off if you tried."

    scene fireflies14
    with dissolve

    m "We’re not...that far off from one another."
    m "We have many of the same values. Just...incredibly different ways of approaching and confronting them."
    s "How are things with you two, by the way?"
    m "What do you mean?"
    s "Just that she’s seemed kind of suspicious of you ever since you started trying to prevent her from making it to the rooftop again."
    m "I wouldn’t be doing that if I {i}wasn’t{/i} suspicious of her."
    m "I think, at the current moment, there is no conceivable way for Ayane and me to {i}not{/i} be suspicious of one another."
    m "From my perspective, she’s...kind of like a glitch. Something that doesn’t belong here and something that needs to have the root cause ironed out so it doesn’t keep happening."
    m "But from her perspective, it probably seems like I’m just trying to keep you to myself."
    s "Are you not?"

    stop music fadeout 10.0

    m "Of course not. Why would I ever do something like that?"
    s "Because you’re in love with me."
    m "Oh, joy. Here we go again."
    s "Why even deny it at this point, Maya?"
    m "Why keep bringing it up if it’s something I’ve already informed you I can’t speak about?"
    s "Probably because I’m in love with you."

    m "Tease you for what? What did you say?"
    s "That I love you."

    scene fireflies18
    with dissolve

    m "How..."
    m "How is your brain not exploding right now?! "
    m "You’re not supposed to be able to say things like that to me!"
    s "Why not?"
    m "Because...Because things have broken down every time I’ve tried to say them to you! "
    m "Do you have any idea how many times I’ve  done it?! How many {i}yous{/i} have gone away because I just did the same exact thing {i}you{/i} just did?!"
    m "Why does that suddenly not matter anymore?! Are the rules gone?! What the fuck is this?!"
    s "Say it back and find out."

    scene fireflies19
    with dissolve

    m "I can’t!"
    s "Why?"
    m "Because I’m scared! "
    m "No words are worth risking you over! "
    s "Then show me without words."
    m "Without...words?"
    s "Is that okay?"

    scene fireflies20

    m "That’s never worked either..."
    s "And to think just minutes ago you were talking about how horrible I am as a person."
    m "You {i}are{/i} horrible! You’re the worst! Deplorable! Degenerate! An evil...{i}evil{/i} man!"
    s "What else?"
    m "Pervert! Lecher! Debauchee!"
    m "Everything evil and everything worse!"
    s "And?"

    m "And..."
    m "If the world ends right now, I won’t care."
    m "I’ll find you again."

    to "Ah! Never mind! I was never here and didn’t see anything! Please go back to having your moment and feel free to entirely disregard my existence from this point onward!"
    m "Moment? What moment? We weren’t doing anything weird. I don’t even like Sensei."
    s "Why would I ever have a moment with someone who spends the entire day insulting me?"
    m "And why would {i}I{/i} ever have a moment with an adult? I’m a normal teenage girl with normal teenage interests and preferences."
    s "Yeah. Maya’s too short and her chest is too small for me."
    m "{i}Okay, that wasn’t necessary and is also blatantly untrue.{/i}"

    s "Yeah. It was interesting and informative and completely free of anything inappropriate between teacher and student."
    to "Just so the two of you are aware and can put an end to this terrible game of charades, I have no intention of telling anyone what I saw."
    m "Saw what? You didn’t see anything."
    s "Yeah. Nothing happened. And if anything did happen, it would have all been one big misunderstanding."
    m "Yup. "

    to "I...was assigned Sensei for Secret Santa this year and, considering the slightly time-sensitive nature of his present, was out looking for him before my driver returns to the manor."
    s "Driver? Your present involves going somewhere?"

    scene fireflies27
    with dissolve

    to "It does. But I’m afraid we must leave right now as I’ve already kept him waiting for far longer than I would have liked due to my hesitancy regarding the matter."

    m "No! Now is fine! Go! I’m gonna...uhh..."
    m "I’m gonna for a walk! Platonically, of course! Which doesn’t really make sense because it’s just a walk by myself and..."

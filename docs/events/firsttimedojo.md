    "I decide to use this brand new lease on life to become a karate champion and check out the dojo."
    "Just kidding."
    "Well, about the karate champion part at least."
    "I just figure that there's a relatively high likelihood of me bumping into someone from class here because..."
    "Wait, why {i}do{/i} I feel like that?"
    "I get lost in quiet contemplation for a moment and don't manage to shrug it off until I can hear the excited pounding of footsteps on the floor mat inching closer to me at a frighteningly rapid pace."

    scene ayanefirstdojo2
    with dissolve

    ay "Sensei? What are {i}you{/i} doing here? I've never seen you come by the dojo before."
    s "Better question: what are {i}you{/i} doing here? You just provided weight to an inner monologue I didn't fully understand and now I have to wrap my head around two things at once."

    scene ayanefirstdojo3
    with dissolve

    ay "Me? I'm training."
    s "Training for what, exactly?"

    scene ayanefirstdojo4
    with dissolve

    ay "{i}Battle.{/i}"
    s "Well, good luck. I can't imagine there's a lot of that around here."
    ay "The first rule of karate is to be ready for anything, especially {i}war.{/i}"
    s "I thought the first rule of karate was to only use it as self-defense?"

    scene ayanefirstdojo5
    with dissolve

    ay "Hmph. Of course that’s what someone without any experience or training would think."
    ay "But me? I’ve been here for centuries...honing the Amamiya family secret techniques...and waiting for the perfect moment to showcase my unwavering bravery and reclaim these lands."
    s "Where was that {i}unwavering bravery{/i} when you ran away from my penis the other day?"

    scene ayanefirstdojo6
    with dissolve

    ay "That was no normal penis! And I know a normal penis when I see one! I have done plenty of research!"
    kin "Amamiya! What the fuck do you think you're yelling about over there?! And who's that guy with you?!"

    scene ayanefirstdojo7
    with dissolve

    ay "Sorry, Miss Osaka! He's my...dad!"
    kin "Your-"
    kin "You know what? Fuck it. I don't want to deal with this right now. Tell him to either pay up or get out."

    scene ayanefirstdojo8
    with dissolve

    ay "You need to pay up or get out, Sensei. I'm already on thin ice from bringing my chicken here all the time and can't afford another demerit."
    s "I have so many questions and feel like none of them are going to be answered."

    scene ayanefirstdojo3
    with dissolve

    ay "If you want to stick around, I wouldn't mind paying for you."
    ay "There's a 50%% discount on your first lesson here and, if you like it, it means we can start spending every single waking moment of every single day together."
    ay "Doesn't that sound amazing?"
    s "No. It sounds loud."
    ay "Loud can be good. That's another thing I've learned from research."
    s "Ayane, how exactly do you spend all of your free time?"
    ay "Thinking about you! Which is where all of the research comes into play. I need to be ready for when {i}you're{/i} ready to love me."
    s "Again, you ran away from a solid opportunity to put that to the test and-"

    scene ayanefirstdojo6
    with dissolve

    ay "Well, forgive me for not expecting the gateway to my dreams to open up in the middle of a sleepover!"
    ay "This isn't one of those sex games that Ami and I {i}accidentally{/i} downloaded while you weren't home, Sensei! Things like that don't happen in real life!"
    ay "I'm a real girl with real feelings and-"
    kin "Amamiya!"
    ay "And a real dad who I am trying to convince to start karate right now!"
    s "I know you're just covering up, but being called that twice in such quick succession is making me feel weird."

    scene ayanefirstdojo9
    with dissolve

    ay "Well...then tell me what you're doing here. Because you still haven't answered that and it feels extremely random if it's not to see me."
    ay "And I haven't even been doing this for long, so I doubt anyone else told you."
    ay "Shouldn’t you be like, spending time with Ami or something?"
    s "Ami is old enough to do things on her own, just like I’m old enough to visit a random dojo in the middle of the afternoon."

    scene ayanefirstdojo3
    with dissolve

    ay "So it {i}is{/i} just a completely random visit without any purpose or goal."
    s "Humans are strange creatures, Ayane. We often do things we can't explain or understand."
    s "Like, you're a teenager in a city nearly devoid of male life and you're spending your afternoon practicing self defense when I imagine all of your friends are off having fun."
    s "What's your explanation for that?"
    ay "I-"
    s "And don't give me that whole {i}it's to reclaim my land{/i} thing again. Why are you {i}really{/i} here?"

    scene ayanefirstdojo10
    with dissolve

    ay "Humans are strange creatures, Sensei. We often do things we can't explain or understand."
    s "See? I'm right. You're no different than me."
    s "We're just two people who somehow landed in a place we don't belong and are now left to either abandon it or adapt."
    ay "I vote for adaptation."
    s "I think we might be members of different parties, then."

    scene ayanefirstdojo11
    with dissolve

    ay "No, no! Hear me out! Karate is crazy fun and {i}great{/i} for your body and mind!"
    ay "Just look what it's done for my muscles! Feel!"

    "Ayane forcefully grabs my wrist and places my hand on one of her biceps."
    "Her arms are so small that I’m able to wrap my entire hand around them, but I {i}do{/i} feel a bit of definition there."

    ay "See? Aren't you impressed?"
    ay "I feel like it was just yesterday you were poking my arms and calling them squishy. Now, I could probably beat you to death blindfolded!"
    s "That's an absurd amount of progress for still being relatively new to this."

    scene ayanefirstdojo3
    with dissolve

    ay "I'm pretty great at stuff when I actually apply myself, you know. And, up until you showed up, I was trying really hard."
    s "Are you saying that I'm the main obstacle preventing you from achieving your goals now?"
    ay "No, I'm saying that there are certain goals that take priority. And one of them decided to show up out of nowhere and surprise me."

    "Unsure of how to respond to that, I shift my gaze across the room to find a good number of girls from all ages doing various drills or...techniques or...whatever you call karate practice."

    scene ayanefirstdojo12
    with dissolve

    "The instructor, who looks around my age (Give or take a few years), swiftly moves from group to group, skeptically locking eyes with me every once in a while as if to say {i}get out.{/i}"
    "Which, to be fair, I probably should. I'm clearly not the...demographic this place is shooting for."
    "But if this is where Ayane is going to be spending most of her time..."
    "Maybe coming around a little more often wouldn't be all that bad?"

    ay "You know...I really wasn't kidding when I suggested that you should enroll here, Sensei."
    s "Wouldn't it be weird, though? I'm the only male and probably the oldest person here."
    ay "I don’t think it would be {i}that{/i} weird. We’d just have to act normal and not be all over each other."
    s "That sounds hard when a great deal of your personality seems to revolve around verbally suffocating me."
    ay "I can hold back if I have to."
    ay "If that's what it takes to get you here, I'll do it."
    s "Ayane-"

    scene ayanefirstdojo10
    with dissolve

    ay "I want more of you, Sensei. A lot more. And I don't just mean that in a weird way."
    ay "I do mean it in a {i}kind of{/i} weird way. But not entirely weird. Maybe like...fifty-fifty?"
    s "And you think one of those fifties would be able to keep the other in check if I decide to start...doing karate or whatever?"
    ay "Isn't that the whole idea of halves? To balance each other out?"
    ay "Join the class, Sensei. I really don't mind paying for you. I put it all on my credit card anyway."
    s "I just...can't foresee myself actually enjoying karate, Ayane."
    ay "Then enjoy my company- the same way I've been enjoying yours for years."
    ay "I'm not young and immature anymore."
    s "Yes you are."

    scene ayanefirstdojo13
    with dissolve

    ay "Okay. Yes, I am...But I am {i}less{/i} young and {i}less{/i} immature."

    scene ayanefirstdojo3
    with dissolve

    ay "And I'm ready to take things to the next level in the least creepy way I could possibly say that which, I admit, still probably sounds kind of creepy."
    s "It's fine. I'm kind of creepy for not walking away by now anyway."
    ay "So..."
    ay "Does this mean we can be creeps together?"

    "I take another look around the dojo and try to figure out if this is really where I want to be spending a good chunk of my time."
    "And...I don't think it is."
    "But when my eyes realign and I'm stuck staring directly ahead-"
    "I make a decision."
    "For sometimes, it's a matter less of {i}where{/i} you are and more {i}who{/i} you're with."
    "And I struggle to say it in a way that wouldn't land me on a list somewhere-"
    "But I think I want more of Ayane just as badly as she wants more of me."

    s "I think it does."

    scene ayanefirstdojo14
    with dissolve

    ay "Heck yeah, let's go!"
    ay "I'll sign the papers right now! You just wait right here, Sensei!"
    s "Wouldn't I need to sign them if-"
    ay "Nope! I've already memorized your signature and used it on several official documents, so you can just leave this part to me!"
    s "What? What documents did-"

    scene ayanefirstdojo1
    with dissolve

    s "Ayane, come on. You can't just walk away without telling me that."

    winds up needing to take several breaks to 'reset' her emotions."

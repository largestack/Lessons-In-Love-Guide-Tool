    "Hi."
    "It’s me again."
    "A short while ago, you saw something you were not supposed to see."
    "Forget about it."
    "Not doing so is dangerous for a number of reasons...but, as I care deeply about you, I will go against the grain and share one of these despite the specific instructions I have been given."
    "Because not doing so would be dangerous for {i}me.{/i}"
    "And I like existing, you know?"
    "I like where I am in life- looking down from the monorail and watching the asphalt centerlines blend together into one continuous stretch of white from my prefecture to yours."
    "Riddled with cars that look like toys...and the wires above and beside me, shaking in the wind as I journey closer to you."
    "Of course, that future hangs in the balance as is."
    "Anyway, you’re probably wondering what that thing I just told you I was going to tell you about is. So I’ll tell you because I told you I’d tell you. But don’t tell anyone because there’s no telling what that would do."
    "The past itself isn’t dangerous."
    "It’s the way it makes you feel that is."
    "Take these words, reel them in through the crack underneath the door of that building I can’t enter, and wrap them around your neck like a scarf, not a noose."
    "Feel comfort in me, for I have felt comfort in you."
    "Even when you thought I never would."

    o "I wonder how much longer they’re going to be in there for."
    o "I figured Rin would have wiped the floor with Yasu by now. No offense, Touka."
    to "None taken. I also expect Rin to emerge victorious as Yasu sometimes forgets to even eat breakfast and I can’t imagine her information retention is very good."
    ima "We’ve got this fancy word for “information retention” called “memory.” Try saying that next time."

    ima "Relax, Mrs. Bezos. I’m just screwing with you and trying to lighten the mood since there’s no telling how long us three are gonna be stuck out here for."
    o "Why don’t we just go inside then? I doubt they locked the doors on us."

    scene outsidethechurch4
    with dissolve

    to "Yasu has mentioned to me on many occasions that the doors are locked for anyone that her god does not acknowledge."
    o "Does her god not acknowledge {i}you?{/i} Aren’t you guys best friends?"
    to "I see her as more of a little sister at this point, but I believe your description is apt as well. Regardless, I see no good coming from acting out against the wishes of one of our classmates."
    ima "Just make out with Rin later. Doing that in church is a no-go anyway. Too many dead saints watching you. Sounds pretty gross if you ask me."

    o "I’m not worried about {i}making out{/i} with her right now. It just feels weird being out {i}here{/i} when all of them are in there."
    ima "Got it. {i}You’re{/i} worried there’s some crazy foursome going on and you ain’t about to lose your woman to our babe-magnet teacher."
    o "And that’s another thing. Why is everyone in our class so...head over heels for him? Doesn’t anyone have any issues with...you know, the whole age gap thing?"
    to "I see no issue with that. I believe the bulk of us are more than capable of making such decisions for ourselves."
    o "Are you telling me {i}you’re{/i} trying to get with him too, Touka? "
    to "Define “get with.” This is a term I don’t believe I’ve heard before."
    ima "She means “Are you trying to bang him?”"
    to "Bang as in sexual intercourse, correct?"
    ima "Correct."
    to "I see."
    to "Then apologies, Otoha- but I don't think you and I are close enough to be discussing such things."
    o "Imani? How about you?"
    ima "Excuse me, Otoha, but I am an adult and I am allowed to sleep with whatever attractive, consenting senpai I {i}want{/i} to sleep with."
    ima "Besides, it’s not like Sensei’s {i}actually{/i} going around sleeping with the class. Not gonna fault the guy for not dodging a bunch of cute, hormonal teens who want to jump his bones."
    o "He’s our {i}teacher.{/i} That’s exactly what he should be doing. And you don’t know for sure that-"
    ima "The more you deny it, the more I think {i}you{/i} just wanna bone him too."

    ima "Because if you don’t, I’m not going to just let you stand there and slander my friend when all he’s done wrong is be mad creepy. That alone describes like, 98%% of guys."

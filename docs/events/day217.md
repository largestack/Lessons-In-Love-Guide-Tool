    m "Would you mind explaining to me why we’re in the hallway instead of next to the people I came here with?"
    s "You came here with me as well, remember? Ayane dragged both of us along."
    m "I only needed to be dragged after finding out you were coming."
    m "I was a willing participant up until that point."
    s "Would you rather be in there listening to Despacito for the fifth time today?"

    scene despacitotwo3
    with dissolve

    m "Good point. Please carry on."

    "School ended a few hours ago and, somehow or another, I wound up coming here with a few of the girls after stopping back at their dorms."
    "I had initially tried tracking down Makoto again, but wasn’t able to find her before she managed to get home."
    "So, not knowing what else to do about the matter, I seek out an all-knowing creature named Maya Makinami. "
    "She’ll probably have some idea of what’s going on with our faithful class representative."

    s "I was wondering if you’ve noticed anything different about Makoto lately."

    scene despacitotwo2
    with dissolve

    m "You mean how she looks dead inside?"
    s "Yeah, that."
    m "Yes. It would be impossible {i}not{/i} to notice."
    m "What did you do to her?"
    m "I can’t absolve you of your sins, but it will at least help me prepare in the event of you attempting to do the same thing to me."
    s "I didn’t do anything..."
    s "She just randomly became all dark and gloomy after the two of us went up to the roof a while ago."
    m "The roof as in...the roof of the[school]?"
    s "That’s probably the only roof I’ve been on in years, so yeah."

    scene despacitotwo4
    with dissolve

    m "What were you two doing up there? That place is off limits."
    s "That’s never stopped you."
    m "I’m only there once every few months. It’s not like I spend my nights off hanging out up there."
    s "Really? Because I wouldn’t put that past you."

    scene despacitotwo5
    with dissolve

    m "Whatever. Why does this involve me? "
    m "I barely ever talk to Makoto. I have no idea what’s going on with her. "
    m "She’s probably just upset that the guy she likes is a creep."
    s "So there’s nothing...weird about the rooftop that would cause her to like...short-circuit or something?"

    scene despacitotwo6
    with dissolve

    m "Short circuit?..."
    m "Do you think we’re all robots now? Is that your new theory?"
    s "I’m assuming that answer means it’s just a normal rooftop after all?"

    scene despacitotwo7
    with dissolve

    m "Of course it’s just a normal rooftop."
    m "The only thing special about it is that it’s the highest point of the city. Other than that it’s just a roof."
    s "Then why do you always go there to do the reset thing? I thought it had some sort of powers or something."

    scene despacitotwo8
    with dissolve

    m "Oh, I don’t really know. I just kind of went there the first time the world ended because strange things tend to happen on rooftops in a lot of the manga and games I read."
    m "I’ve just kept going back ever since. "
    m "I guess you could say it’s become a bit of a tradition."
    s "I forgot you were even into that kind of stuff."
    m "Yes. Surprise. I have interests."
    m "My life does not revolve around sweeping a shrine and waiting for you to ask me the right questions."
    m "To be fair, though, the rooftop {i}is{/i} technically the only place I’ve ever watched the world change. So maybe there’s something to it after all?"
    s "I really expected you to have a little more information than just that."
    m "I’m sorry to have let you down."
    s "You don’t look very sorry."
    m "I’m not. I was lying."

    scene despacitotwo9
    with dissolve

    m "The thing with Makoto is kind of strange, though. "

    if bonus == True:
        m "If she started acting that way after coming down from the rooftop and what you’re saying about not assaulting her is true, maybe she...saw something?"

    scene despacitotwo10
    with dissolve

    m "Did she say anything you found odd?"
    s "Anything I found odd?"

    "Hmm..."
    "Pretty much everything she said yesterday struck me as odd."
    "The girl near the lockers was barely even Makoto at all."
    "There was no hope left in her eyes."
    "All I saw was an unending emptiness that not even the glare of the fluorescent hallway lights could brighten up."

    s "She did start talking about how everything is pointless and how god isn’t real at some point."
    m "And then what?"
    s "And then I..."
    m "…"
    m "Well?"

    if bonus == True:
        s "And then I kind of instinctively pinned her against the locker and asked her to come up to the roof with me."
    else:
        s "I tried to hug her but I moved a little too quickly and made it awkward..."

    m "…"
    s "…"

    scene despacitotwo11
    with dissolve

    m "Are you sure {i}you're{/i} not the one who needs help?"

    if bonus == True:
        m "Because it sounds to me like she was just depressed and you tried to take advantage of that to bring her somewhere private."

    s "Yeah, that part doesn’t sound good thinking back on it."
    s "But I swear, something is going on with her. "

    scene despacitotwo12
    with dissolve

    m "Well, on the bright side, it’s possible that she’ll go back to normal very soon."
    m "With the world ending again in the next few days or weeks, she might just be the normal Makoto again once we usher in Winter."
    m "But I guess we won’t really know until that happens."
    s "Has anyone ever changed that drastically before?"

    scene despacitotwo13
    with dissolve

    m "Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup."
    s "…"
    m "…"
    s "That’s directed at me, isn’t it?"
    m "Was it my eyebrows or my eyes that gave you that idea?"
    m "Or perhaps the elongated “yup?”"
    s "A mixture of all three. Was I really that bad?"
    m "Don’t even get me started."

    scene despacitotwo14
    with dissolve

    m "But yes. Changes like that are possible. Though they seem to be very rare for anyone but you."
    m "You’re an entirely different case. You change personalities faster than a girl getting off of a long-term relationship changes her hairstyle."
    m "I’m surprised you even made it this far as {i}you{/i}, to be honest."
    m "Do you have any idea how much trouble you’ve caused me in the past?"
    s "I feel like I’m being scolded right now."
    m "…"

    "I can hear Maya take a deep breath as she desperately prevents herself from carrying on her impromptu lecture any further."

    m "I’m going back inside now."
    m "Ayane will probably take a break after one or two more Despacitos and then we can order food and I will finally feel whole again."
    s "Sure. I’ll follow you in."
    m "Please do not."

    scene black
    with dissolve

    "Maya walks into the karaoke booth and, lo and behold, Ayane is singing the same song as always."
    "Ami reluctantly sings along, albeit with significantly worse Spanish, and I question why these girls continue to bring Ayane here if all they ever get out of it is misery."

    scene despacitotwo15
    with dissolve

    m "Why are you sitting right next to me?"
    m "There’s plenty of seating in this room and literally anywhere else would be better than where you chose."
    s "But I wasn’t done talking to you yet."
    m "But {i}I{/i} was done talking to {i}you{/i}. I really don’t know anything else about Makoto or the rooftop so just wait it out and see what happens."
    m "Do you have enough self-control to do that? Or are you going to explode?"
    m "If you’re going to explode, please go back out into the hallway. Ayane’s voice is loud enough. Any more noise will make my ears bleed."

    scene despacitotwo16
    with dissolve

    a "Hi~"
    a "What are you two doing?"
    a "You were out in the hallway for a really long time."
    a "If I didn’t know any better, I’d think Maya was trying to steal you from me."
    m "Please get your [uncle] out of my sight. He’s roughly three miles too close right now."
    s "Okay now that’s just excessive."
    a "Heheh~ This is exactly why I wasn’t worried about you two being alone."
    a "Did I hear Makoto’s name come up, though?"
    s "Oh, yeah. Still trying to figure out what’s going on with her."
    a "No luck yesterday then?"
    s "None at all."
    a "Oh well. I guess all there is to do is just let her be swallowed by her infinite sadness and get on with our lives."

    scene despacitotwo17
    with dissolve

    a "And speaking of getting on with our lives..."
    m "...What?"
    m "Why are you looking at me like that?"
    a "Because we’re going shopping for winter clothes together soon."
    m "...Okay, but why does that call for angry eyebrows and a maniacal grin?"

    scene despacitotwo18
    with dissolve

    a "I don’t know. I just felt like making that face. Like I was forcing you to come even though I know you like trying on new clothes."
    s "You do?"

    scene despacitotwo19
    with dissolve

    m "Yes. Surprise. I have interests."
    a "You should come too, Sensei!"
    a "I still haven’t started at the maid cafe yet, so I don’t have any money and I need you to buy me warm stuff or I will freeze to death and you’ll have to pay even more for a funeral."
    s "I can just bury you in the backyard, it’s fine."
    a "That works. At least my ghost wouldn’t have to walk very far to find you."

    scene despacitotwo20
    with dissolve

    m "Unfortunately, Sensei has plans that day and can not accompany us. What a shame."
    s "Don’t just decide I have plans, Maya."
    m "It was worth a shot."
    a "So you’ll come then?"
    s "Sure. Not like I have anything else I need to do."
    s "Tomorrow night is fine, right? Does that work for everyone?"
    ay "DEESSS-PAAAFFFFFTTTT- TOMORROW?!"

    scene despacitotwo21
    with dissolve

    ay "But I have stuff to do tomorrow and I wanna come!"
    s "You and I can go together a different day, Ayane."

    a "Yeah! But I’m going to come to that too so I can make sure Ayane keeps her hands off of you."

    scene despacitotwo22
    with dissolve

    if bonus == True:
        ay "It’s fine. You’ll still be able to help me out in the fitting room, Sensei."
        a "No you will not. That’s not even legal."

    m "Hah..."
    m "This really never stops being troublesome..."

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "And so we proceed to finalize our plans for winter shopping tomorrow night."
    "Apparently, the mall normally gets busy this time of year with people shopping for their significant others and whatnot."
    "Just, with so many significant others being {b}in fucking space{/b}, I can’t imagine the mall will be nearly as busy as Ami expects it to be."
    "Either way, it looks like tomorrow might wind up being a bit more eventful than an average Friday, so I’ll need to brace my wallet and prepare for whatever is to come."
    "I’m sure it will all be worth it in the end, though."

    if bonus == True:
        "Winter clothes are a special type of attractive."
        "I’m all about seeing cute girls naked, but something about layers upon layers upon layers makes me feel a little different than any other type of outfit possibly can."
        "Some people may tell you that the reason for this is because it adds to the mystery of {i}what could be underneath the clothes{/i}-"
        "But, as someone who has seen a sizable portion of these girls nude already, I can guarantee it’s much more than that."
        "And suddenly, tomorrow can’t come soon enough..."

    "Each step I take toward the hidden clearing feels a lot like walking on glass but, in a slightly poetic and only partially metaphorical way, I guess it kind of is."
    "In a less metaphorical way and more of a self-reflective one, it’s probably safe to say I’ve been doing that for quite some time with Noriko."
    "That every single road I’ve taken to her involved me cutting my soles while wishfully believing that the pressure of forward momentum would keep too much blood from escaping."
    "But now, all this time later, I’m infected in both of my legs and the pain has become so much to bear that amputation is really the only alternative."
    "I’m getting too far off track, aren’t I?"
    "Of course I am. That’s what I do."
    "Run, but only until there’s something blocking your path. Then turn around and run in the opposite direction."
    "Rinse, repeat. Rinse, repeat."
    "You can never get lost if you’re only alternating between forward and backward. That much is simple enough for anyone to understand."
    "But what do you do when new obstacles appear during those swaps from right to left or west to east or whichever form of direction you choose to use?"
    "What do you do when your area to run is no greater than the length of your body?"
    "I’m still too far off...yet the obstacles are closing in and the teeth of the allegory are decayed to the point where they can no longer lift me up by the skin of my neck and carry me off to safety."
    "Do you know what that makes me?"
    "Of course you do."
    "You’ve known all along."
    "You just hate admitting it because you want to chop my legs off."

    "I find the heart Noriko drew in the sand."
    "It’s anatomically correct and eerily similar to her own."
    "I know what it looks like since it’s stuck to her sleeve."

    s "..."
    s "I came."
    n "Already? But you haven’t even put it in. Am I really that beautiful?"
    s "Yup. Been saving that one up for thirty-one years, too. So thanks for the tension relief, but I’ll be on my way now."
    n "If that’s what I wanted...I’d probably have it by now, huh?"
    s "Noriko?"

    scene norikofire2
    with dissolve

    n "Sorry, that came out a little hornier...more vague and...kind of bitchier than it sounded in my head. "
    n "Just...vocally reflecting on how the biggest barrier to our current relationship is how picky I’ve been with the way things have to go."

    scene norikofire3
    with dissolve

    n "Basically...I could have chosen to be another Kirin. Someone who’s there to comfort you physically while neglecting the emotional aspect of the relationship between us...but I didn’t. Because I want more."
    n "It’s just that wanting more keeps us further away. "
    n "Who knows if it will take thirty-{i}two{/i} years for you to {i}actually{/i} relieve that tension? Or thirty-three? Or thirty-four? Why not forty?"
    n "How long will it be before we finally become one? When will the comfort I feel stop being laced by caveats and uncertainties? And when will {i}you{/i} accept that it’s okay to feel loved?"

    scene norikofire4
    with dissolve

    n "Anyway, that’ll suffice as a melancholic pre-bonfire monologue. Come sit. It’s not much of a Christmas date if you stand twenty feet behind me while I slowly toss all of my baggage at you."
    s "Fine. But I’ve got another caveat or rule or whatever it is you want to call it. "
    n "Hit me. I’m used to them by now."
    s "If you go on one more tangent about the distance between us and how you’re not sure how you’re going to conquer it, I am going to punch you in face."
    n "What if I’m into that sort of thing?"
    s "Then feel free to go on your tangent and regress in the form of having violent, fireside sex with me while abandoning your need to groom me into husband material."

    scene norikofire5
    with dissolve

    n "Hey now, I might be a lot of things, but I am certainly not a groomer. I’ve just staked my entire life on a future with you and-"
    s "Careful. You’re approaching punching territory."

    scene norikofire6
    with dissolve

    n "Fine. Sit. "
    n "But could you grab my guitar by that bench over there first? I’m going to fidget too much without something to hold onto and am too much of a coward to make the first move on you."
    s "I am suddenly conflicted about whether I should get your guitar or just tackle you."
    n "No one would ever know if you did. And I’m barely clothed to begin with. "
    n "And also very obedient when it comes to sex stuff. Probably. No experience, but I’m pretty sure that’s how it’s going to be if my fantasies are any indicator."
    s "You’re {i}trying{/i} to make this hard for me, aren’t you?"
    n "Not purposely."
    n "But I’d be lying if I said making things more complicated than they have to be isn’t my thing, so..."
    n "Grab my guitar...or grab me. Whichever one you want. "
    n "I’ll be happy as long as I have something to hold onto."

    n "Look at you! Turning down the perfect opportunity to further our relationship! "
    n "If I didn’t know any better and you weren’t a six foot tall male, I might even think I’m looking at myself right now. "
    s "I think I understand how you want things to go by now. So I’m willing to suppress my immense sexual desire for you if it means making you happy."
    n "Thank you, Sensei. I will also consider suppressing my immense sexual desire for you so that we can {i}both{/i} be happy. "
    n "Unless that burden becomes too much to bear. In that case, please take care of me and do not hesitate to leave your hand prints all over my body. Like, for real. I want bruises."
    s "I’ll keep that in mind, but I’m not really sure about the bruising thing when you’re in regular contact with both your family and my ex-girlfriend."
    n "Your ex-girlfriend is {i}also{/i} my family, you know. And currently very pissed off that you are with {i}me{/i} instead of her."

    scene norikofire8
    with dissolve

    s "She knows?"
    n "Well, not {i}directly.{/i} I didn’t tell her we made plans or anything. She just knows that we’re both in the same place at the same time and that you never responded to her date request."
    n "But hey, she’s pissed off at {i}me{/i} as well since I also bailed on her."
    s "If I knew I’d be dating both of you on Christmas and wasn’t subject to sudden timeskips, that would have changed everything and I probably wouldn’t even be here right now."
    n "I think Nee-chan and I are a little too competitive to both date you at the same time. Also, what?"
    s "Long story. Not believable. But what sort of plans did you have with Niki that you wound up abandoning for my sake?"

    scene norikofire9
    with dissolve

    n "I agreed to help her with her Christmas concert before I knew we were doing our trip {i}here{/i}."
    n "Originally figured I could just bounce once the show ended and meet up with everybody afterward. Kinda like I did last year, but with fewer mementos of the past and less martyrdom."
    n "Just hope she was able to find a replacement in time since I was going to do backup for a few of her songs."
    s "You...were going to be on stage with Niki?"

    scene norikofire10
    with dissolve

    n "Mhm. What’s wrong? Upset you didn’t get to see me in a cute idol costume?"
    s "I just didn’t really think music like that was your style."
    n "I’ve been up there with Niki a few times. The idol industry might be antithetical to my personal values as a musician and activist, but she’s my sister and I like money. So yeah, I’d do it."
    s "I learned something about you today."
    n "Is it that I’m a sellout?"
    s "No. It’s that prototype Noriko is actually pretty cool."

    scene norikofire11
    with dissolve

    n "She is?"
    s "Yeah. Ignoring the familial aspect of that, compromising on your morals for a higher chance at self-progress is the mark of a smart person."
    n "Are you only saying that because you want me to compromise on more personal beliefs and fuck your brains out right now?"
    s "My suppression tactics are obviously not perfect. I know."
    n "If it’s any consolation, I did not have complete faith in myself tonight either. "
    n "This is evidenced by the pack of condoms that I brought along even though Kirin laughed in my face for it before informing me that you would never wear one in a million years."
    s "Say what you want about her morals, but she knows me well."
    n "That’s cool. I’ll just make balloons out of them if I get bored or something."
    s "You’ve got a guitar too, you know. Aren’t those supposed to help with boredom?"
    n "Amongst other things."
    s "Like trying to impress the people you love in front of dozens of {i}other{/i} people who are suddenly invited into the same stream of emotion and general consciousness?"
    n "And looking cool, yeah. "

    n "There’s a lot you can do with a guitar. Or any instrument. Or just...art in general, really. "
    n "Do you know why I started playing in the first place, Sensei?"
    s "Probably to win my heart or something."
    n "Well, yes. There is that. But I never would have taken to it in the first place if I wasn’t trying to follow in your footsteps."
    s "I have never touched a guitar in my life. Probably."
    n "No...but I used to love reading your poetry."
    n "You’re not very outwardly emotional, so the things you wrote were like little windows into your heart."
    n "And I thought that, if one day, I could make enough windows to my heart as well, you’d finally see just how much space there is inside of me for you."
    s "Suppress it, Noriko."
    n "Not vaginal space. Emotional space. I don’t think I have much to offer in terms of the former. But hey, if what I hear is true, that’ll just make it better for you."
    s "Noriko-"

    n "I’m sure the atmosphere was a major factor in your {i}previous{/i} reaction, but...that came out of nowhere. And you’ll know what’s coming this time."

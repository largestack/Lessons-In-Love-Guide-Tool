    "Less than twelve hours ago, around the time I was enveloped in the flesh of a girl whose name just found her way onto paper, the fabric of my shirt stuck to my skin from sweat brought on by the summer sun."
    "The sun is dead now. And the moon is simply too small and too dormant to bleed the same heat its older brother does. "
    "Ayane is gone, though she won’t be joining Noriko at the hotel."
    "Instead, she’s headed home to ponder over a tangible list of my misdeeds that aren’t {i}really{/i} misdeeds because I never promised myself to any one person in the first place."

    "There were too many names on the list. I should have marked down less."
    "I should have kept the one signature in ink as the only one on the page and thrown myself into a lie that we could hide behind until we’re sent back to the beginning."
    "Maybe then, she’ll be able to fall for a version of me that won’t neglect her the way I do."
    "Maybe then, she’ll be able to live a life devoid of rooftops and resets and just enjoy her time in this endless cycle."

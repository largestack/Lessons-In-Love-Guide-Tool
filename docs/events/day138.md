    a "I don’t like the tone of your voice, Sensei...But I’m going to ignore it because I’m such a great [niece] and want to tell you about the thing I heard."

    "Well...at least it seems like whatever this rumor is doesn’t involve anything that could get me fired- which is great news."
    "It would be one thing to lose my job over something like that, but I’m actually a little more terrified of what Ami would do to me if she ever found out."

    s "I’m sorry...what transfer students?"

    with dissolve

    s "Oh. So they’re not like, technically {i}transfer students.{/i} They’re just switching classes."
    mak "Sure. If that makes it easier for you to understand."

    "I can’t help but feel like I asked the wrong question."

    else:
        a "Yes, Sensei. Is that {i}really{/i} the only question you have? Especially with a badminton pro right in front of you?"

    mak "Thank you, Ami. I didn’t realize you looked at me that way."

    scene premolly16
    with dissolve

    a "I don’t. I think you’re ugly and stupid. I was talking about me."

    if bonus == True:
        mak "Oh, I see. You’re trying to get your [uncle] to notice how attractive you think you are. That is not at all abnormal. "
        mak "It would make much more sense for Sensei to be attracted to someone he isn’t related to. And since I am the only other girl in this room, that would have to be me."
        a "Oh, please. The only person who would ever be attracted to you is like...a...weird person...or something."
        mak "…"

    mak "Is that really all you can come up with?"
    a "Shut up. I’m cute and you’re gross. "
    s "If you two wouldn’t mind, I’d really like to hear more about this transfer situation now."

    s "Ami. Stop."
    a "Hmph..."
    mak "I wish I had more details to share with you, but all I really know right now is that two girls are going to be transferring over from Ms. Watabe’s class in the near future."
    mak "Ms. Watabe is a bit...closed-off. So she was only willing to discuss {i}some{/i} of the situation with me."
    mak "Regardless, I think we can expect at least one of them in the next few days. I just haven't been notified of which one yet."

    scene premolly19
    with dissolve

    a "Wait, is it really Ms. Watabe’s class that the girls are transferring from? I heard it was a different teacher."
    mak "I’m not quite sure {i}where{/i} you would have heard anything. My information came directly from the principal. "
    a "Oh, sorry. I forgot you spend too much time studying to know what ‘rumors’ are."

    scene premolly20
    with dissolve

    mak "O-Of course I know what rumors are! Forgive me for caring more about my education than my social circle!"
    s "So basically, I’m going to get two random girls just thrown into my class in the middle of the[school] year and I can’t do anything about it?"

    scene premolly21
    with dissolve

    mak "In layman’s terms, yes."
    s "Are they aware of my...teaching methods?"
    mak "Your original ones or your current ones?"
    s "Current ones."
    mak "Absolutely not. "
    mak "They are in for a rude awakening if they are actually trying to learn."
    a "But on the bright side, if they’re normal girls who don’t care about that sort of thing, you’ll be a-okay."
    mak "I like to believe that normal girls at least slightly care about their futures, so I don’t know if I’d count on that, Sensei."

    "Unfortunately for Makoto, I think I’d much prefer Ami’s type rather than hers in the class."
    "That’s not to say I don’t like Makoto. In fact, I think it’s pretty obvious that I like her a lot."
    "But more than one of her would just be way too much for me. I can barely keep up with her wealth of knowledge as-is."

    s "Well, I guess we’ll just have to see what happens then, right?"
    mak "Correct. I’ll handle most of the legwork for you, so all you really need to do is just have them introduce themselves once they transfer in."
    s "Really? Does the staff really trust you enough to handle that sort of thing instead of me?"

    scene premolly22
    with dissolve

    mak "Of course. If anything, I’d even say they trust me {i}more{/i} than you."
    s "Yeah...that makes sense."

    "Guess I can’t really blame them for that."

    mak "Exactly. So, I suppose you can just keep doing what you always do and just deal with things as they come up."

    if bonus == True:
        mak "And in the meantime, I’ll see if there are any strings I can pull to get you one of the cuter girls."
    else:
        mak "And in the meantime, I guess I'll get back to badminton practice."

    scene premolly24
    with hpunch

    a "Wait a minute! Whose side are you even on?!"
    mak "The side that makes him happy."
    mak "I figured you’d be on that side too, Ami. Given how much you claim to care about him and all."

    scene premolly25
    with dissolve

    a "You...did NOT just say what I think you said, did you?..."
    mak "And with that, I shall take my leave. It’s been nice talking with you, Sensei."

    scene premolly26

    play sound "dooropen.mp3"

    "Makoto suddenly vanishes from the office, leaving Ami in a fit of rage that she is unable to cope with."

    a "I’ll be right back..."
    a "I need to go commit a felony..."

    scene premolly1
    with dissolve
    play sound "dooropen.mp3"

    "And then Ami disappears as well."
    "…"
    "That’s interesting, though."
    "Two new students out of virtually nowhere."
    "I feel like the normal reaction for someone in my shoes would be something along the lines of, “Oh no. Extra work.”"

    if bonus == True:
        "But, being a man of culture and little-to-no-ethics..."
        "I’m still just hoping they’re cute. "

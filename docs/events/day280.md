    "I make my way down the halls of the[school] after another uneventful day in class."
    "We’re beginning to near the end of the transfer process, so the halls have been a little more crowded than usual lately."
    "Thankfully, another janitor died during gym this afternoon, so all of the girls have been sent home early. "
    "Or, at least they were {i}supposed{/i} to be sent home early."
    "I think they’re all becoming so desensitized to custodial manslaughter that they just use these happenings as excuses to increase their club time."
    "As such, the manga club is doing manga stuff...the soccer club is doing soccer stuff...and the going home club is doing something actually worthwhile."
    "And me? I’m just...wandering the hallway, trying to figure out if there are any vending machines I may have missed when making my mental map of the[school]."

    scene black
    with dissolve

    "I find out shortly after thinking this that my mental map must be almost entirely correct as, of course, there are no additional machines anywhere."
    "Welp, there goes my fun activity for the day as I wait for Makoto to finish all of my paperwork."
    "I guess I could always go check in on her and-"

    f "Oh, Sensei!"

    "A-ha. Another excuse to kill time."

    scene nodokafutabahall1
    with dissolve

    "Thanks to Futaba, I don’t have to face the fact that I still {i}technically{/i} have work to do and-"

    if bonus == True:
        no "Nodoka Nagasawa. We met once in the library and discussed Futaba’s breasts."
    else:
        no "Huh? I forget."

    s "Oh, right. You’re the one who said you were into [incest]."

    scene nodokafutabahall2
    with dissolve

    f "That’s...not really the best thing to remember about her, Sensei..."
    no "I disagree wholeheartedly, Futaba."
    no "In fact, if there is one thing {i}worth{/i} remembering about me, it is that I accept all couples regardless of any potential stigmas surrounding them."
    s "Right."
    s "Well, see you around I guess."

    scene nodokafutabahall3
    with dissolve

    f "Wait! There’s actually a reason I stopped you."
    no "A confession of love? Let me get my notebook."
    no "To think you'd go so far as to wait for your best friend to be around so she can witness it..."
    no "Futaba, I’m touched."
    s "I am ready for the confession."

    scene nodokafutabahall4
    with dissolve

    f "There is no confession! I wanted to talk to you about Nodoka moving into our class!"
    s "Is that a thing that’s happening?"

    scene nodokafutabahall5
    with dissolve

    f "Well...she’s in Miss Watabe’s class right now since I...don’t think they wanted to move anyone else into ours."
    s "That’s completely understandable."
    s "Are you enjoying your time with that ball of sunshine, Nodoka?"
    no "I’m actually quite enjoying Miss Watabe’s class. I find the tightness of her skirt to be extremely alluring."
    no "I don’t think she likes me very much, however."
    s "And why is that?"
    no "Because I make her life a living hell."
    f "Nodoka is...a little too smart for her own good."
    no "I don’t think it’s my intellect that has anything to do with it. I just really annoy her."
    s "Wait a second...You're not the haiku girl, are you?"
    no "Yes, that would be me.\nNodoka Nagasawa.\nI’m the haiku girl."
    no "To be fair, I only did that for one day. But because of it, she has forever painted me as yet another “pathetic miscreant” in those beautiful, tired eyes of hers."
    f "So...if it’s okay with you, I was thinking maybe Nodoka could transfer into our class..."
    f "It would probably help make all of us look a little better, too..."
    s "What do you mean by “look a little better?” How can we not look good when I give everyone A’s in everything?"
    f "That’s...kind of the issue."
    f "People are starting to think that you might be taking it a little too easy on us since no one ever fails."
    s "That’s fine. I’ll just give Yumi and Maya F’s for always being mean to me."
    s "That should set the record straight, right?"

    scene nodokafutabahall6
    with dissolve

    f "Um...I don’t think that’s...a thing you should be doing..."
    f "I’m just saying that Nodoka has the highest standardized test score in Kumon-mi and that just having her around would bring our average way up."
    s "Really? The [incest] girl has the highest standardized test score in Kumon-mi?"
    no "Yes, say it loud enough for the whole[school] to hear."
    no "Just not the test part, I’d prefer that remain low key."
    s "You...want me to broadcast to the entire[school] that I’m calling you the “[incest] girl?”"
    no "That or “Futaba Fukuyama’s quirky but lovable childhood friend and future wife.”"

    if bonus == True:
        s "Incest girl is much shorter. We can just go with that."
    else:
        s "Sorry, Nodoka. I'll try harder."

    no "Understood. It will be a pleasure working with you from now on, Sensei."
    no "I do have several conditions, however, since you'll be benefiting so much from my inclusion."
    s "Is one of the conditions that I give you Futaba?"
    no "Of course not."

    if bonus == True:
        no "You just need to let me watch when you inevitably go to town on her supple, sensual body."
    else:
        no "You just have to sign Futaba to a ten year contract of being your egg tossing competition partner."

    scene nodokafutabahall7

    f "Nodoka!"
    no "If I can’t have you, Sensei will."
    s "This seems like a good deal for me."
    no "I shall live vicariously through him. I’m sure you understand."
    f "I don’t!"

    scene nodokafutabahall8
    with dissolve

    no "Regardless, that’s just one of several conditions. I’ll lay the rest out for you in your office tomorrow after I assemble the appropriate squadron."
    s "Squadron?..."
    no "It’s really just one person I’m going to enlist the help of. But if we are ever going to enact change in this[school], it is something that must be done."

    scene nodokafutabahall9
    with dissolve

    no "In the meantime, our first course of action should be informing Miss Watabe and her extremely tight skirt that she won’t need to deal with me for much longer."
    w "What are you saying about my skirt, Nagasawa?"

    scene nodokafutabahall10
    with dissolve

    no "Oh, good! You’re here."
    s "She was just talking about how nicely your clothes fit you, Wakana."
    w "For the last time, call me Miss Watabe around the students."

    if bonus == True:
        no "Oh, gothic teacher.\nMy body craves thy soft touch.\nPlease destroy my loins."
    else:

    scene nodokafutabahall11

    if bonus == True:
        no "{i}Take me.{/i}"

    s "Fine by me. You were planning on pawning her off on me anyway, weren’t you?"
    w "I was under the assumption that her behavior had improved and wasn’t going to make anything more of it."
    w "But, unlike you, I don’t enjoy the prospect of students pining after me. It clouds their judgement and makes it so I can’t instruct them properly."

    if bonus == False:
        s "I can not help it if women are attracted to my exceptional teaching strategies and concern for their futures."

    no "I will do anything you say, my dearest Annabel Lee."

    scene nodokafutabahall12
    with dissolve

    w "Please put me out of my misery."

    w "…"
    w "Oh, are we just ignoring her apparent affinity for [incest]?"

    w "…"

    scene nodokafutabahall13
    with dissolve

    w "I want to fucking die."
    no "Don’t we all, Miss Watabe? Don’t we all..."

    scene nodokafutabahall14
    with dissolve

    no "Well, I think that went just great. Wouldn’t you agree?"
    s "It went more or less how every single conversation with her goes."
    s "I’m a little surprised by how open you are with teachers, though. I was thinking you were only like that with me because of things you heard from Futaba."
    no "What could I possibly gain by hiding my true self from anyone?"
    s "You would be very surprised."
    no "Then educate me, Sensei. That {i}is{/i} your job, is it not?"
    no "Should we begin our very first lesson right here in the hall?"
    s "I wouldn’t call it a “lesson” per se. I just think it’s a little unreasonable to rule out manipulation as a means of getting things you want from people."

    scene nodokafutabahall15
    with dissolve

    no "Oh?"

    if bonus == True:
        f "Do you...often do things like that, Sensei?"
    else:
        f "Do you...really think like that, Sensei?"

    "Yes."

    s "Not {i}often{/i}, but I think everyone manipulates people from time to time."
    s "Whether it be pretending to remember a family member you see at a gathering after many years apart or just..."
    s "Something simpler. Like threatening to talk to someone’s manager to get a discount on something."
    s "Manipulation is a way of life."
    s "So when Nodoka says things like “What can I gain from hiding my true self?” the logical answer is “A lot.”"
    f "…"
    s "…"
    no "I like you."
    no "You’re no Miss Watabe, but I definitely like you."
    s "Thanks. I figured things could go either way after saying that."

    scene nodokafutabahall16
    with dissolve

    f "Didn’t I tell you that you and Sensei would get along? You two have a lot in common."
    no "Just having things in common isn’t enough to get along. But yes, I can see what it is that {i}you{/i} see in him."

    scene nodokafutabahall17
    with dissolve

    no "That tangent of yours {i}does{/i} call into question whether or not you’ve been manipulating my darling Futaba this whole time, though."
    no "And perhaps your talk on manipulation itself was an attempt to manipulate {i}me{/i} into thinking you are more than just the average teacher. "
    no "You’ve given me much to think about in such a short amount of time. This is good."
    f "Well I...can’t say for certain, but I don’t think Sensei would ever do something like that to any of the girls in class."
    f "He genuinely cares about all of us."

    scene nodokafutabahall18
    with dissolve

    f "He just shows it in...different ways sometimes."
    no "Yes. Inject that cuteness directly into my veins, Futaba. Feed me more of your adorable, innocent blushing until I can consume no more."

    if bonus == True:
        no "Come! Let us tear each other’s clothes off in the science lab and compare how much we have grown!"

        scene nodokafutabahall19

        f "How many times do you need to compare that?!"
        no "As many as it takes."

    if bonus == True:
        no "As close as Miss Watabe’s skirt is to those shapely, pale thighs of hers."

    f "I wouldn’t say {i}that{/i} close, but yes. We’re very good friends, whether Nodoka constantly jokes about being more or not."

    scene nodokafutabahall21
    with dissolve

    no "To have one’s love dismissed as mere joking after all these years...how utterly heartbreaking."
    s "Things will get better, Nodoka. Pretty soon, you’ll be able to tease Futaba for almost seven hours a day."
    s "And in front of an audience."

    scene nodokafutabahall22
    with dissolve

    f "Don’t encourage her!"
    no "You’re right! I didn’t even think of things that way!"
    no "The prospect of getting to spend more time with Futaba was enticing enough, but watching her face grow bright red as I embarrass her in front of her peers?"
    no "I don’t know if I’ve ever been this excited before."

    "Well, it will certainly be interesting having a resident Futaba hype-man around to counteract all of the horrible things Yumi is constantly throwing at her."
    "Whenever she actually shows up, that is."
    "But apart from this, I feel like there are a few other things Nodoka can bring to the table as well."
    "Because not only is she apparently smart enough to somehow dispel suspicions about my class having it easy by just being there-"

    if bonus == True:
        "But she is openly a gigantic pervert."
        "And cute."
        "Everyone wins and today is a good day."

    no "I’m sure the transfer will process by then, but I don’t want to formally introduce myself to everyone until our mission is complete."
    s "Mission? Are you talking about that thing you need a squadron for?"
    no "Precisely. But, like I said, I’ll provide more details tomorrow."
    no "For now, my good friend {size=-15}and future wife{/size} Futaba is going to give me a tour of the area so I can begin to get acclimated."
    no "I’d normally be fine with inviting you, but I’d feel horrible if you wound up being a third wheel."
    f "At this rate, I feel like {i}I’ll{/i} wind up becoming the third wheel."
    s "That’s not true. Nodoka clearly has her sights set on you, Futaba."

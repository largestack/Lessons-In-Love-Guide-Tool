    "School ended about an hour ago. And with Makoto now returning to class (And refusing to take a break from doing more work than everyone) I am left with nothing do to but, once again, wander the halls."
    "My wandering is not aimless this time, though- for I’ve already decided to pay a visit to the manga club to provide some...advice. Or whatever it is an advisor is supposed to provide."
    "Did anyone {i}ask{/i} for this advice? No. But everyone knows that people who go around providing unsolicited advice to everyone are great and awesome and definitely not annoying."

    "As I begin to pull the door open, I notice a distinct lack of chatter. Meaning I am either disturbing silent reading or-"

    "Or Ayane and Molly are about to have sex."
    "I should have known something like this would happen the moment my penis was banned from being inside of her."

    ay "Hi!"
    s "So this is how it’s going to be, huh?"

    scene ayanefitting2
    with dissolve

    ay "How what’s going to be? "
    s "The future."
    ay "What?"
    s "Anyway, what’s going on in here? Why is Molly groping you?"
    mo "Taking measurements, Sir. For Ayane’s Halloween costume."
    s "That is not how you measure someone."
    mo "Aye. But it is how things would work in a video game and it provides much needed fan service for when people complain about the lack of sexual content."
    mo "Also, Ayane’s skin is soft and touching it gives me an XP boost."

    scene ayanefitting3
    with dissolve

    ay "Moisturize daily! Remember that, guys and girls!"
    s "I’m good. I’ve survived 31 years without ever having to do that and I do not intend to start now even {i}if{/i} it would make Molly more inclined to put her hands all over my body for a...boost thing."
    mo "No, Sir. If I laid hands on you only to find that your skin rivaled Ayane’s in terms of softness, the only status effect I’d receive would be confusion. And I have already hurt myself enough for the next year, thank you."

    scene ayanefitting4
    with dissolve

    ay "Aren’t you proud of me, Sensei? "
    s "For what? Having a tryst with a small, Irish girl on school grounds?"
    ay "No. For keeping my body in tip-top shape so we’ll be able to go fifty rounds on the night of our wedding."

    "Is {i}that{/i} how Chika does it? Moisturizing?"
    "Maybe I {i}should{/i} start doing that if it yields those sorts of benefits."

    s "Sure, whatever. I’m proud."
    ay "I’ll bet. You haven’t taken your eyes off of me this entire time."
    s "Why would I? Fanservice is cool."
    mo "Arms up."

    scene ayanefitting5
    with dissolve

    ay "Yes, ma’am."
    s "Correction- fanservice is {i}very{/i} cool."
    mo "Hmm..."
    mo "These feel bigger than I remember them. "
    ay "When was the last time you grabbed them?"
    mo "Last Halloween, I believe."
    ay "Don’t you think it’s weird that there have been multiple Halloweens in our first year of-"

    scene ayanefitting6
    with dissolve

    mo "What do you think, Sir? Want to give ‘em a grab and see how they compare to your memory? Assuming you’re not already providing every day checks for Ayane, that is."
    s "Ahh, those were the days."
    ay "Go ahead, Sensei. I don’t mind."
    s "I’m going to refrain from groping you in front of your classmates for now, Ayane."
    mo "Is it even groping if it is for the sake of fashion, Sir?"
    s "I’m sure that would sound great in court. Thanks, Molly."

    scene ayanefitting7
    with dissolve

    mo "‘Tis no trouble at all, Sir. I’m simply doing my job as club president."
    s "I understand now why you wanted the role. "
    mo "Sir, I’ve touched so many boobs at this point that I may as well be immune to them."
    ay "I can’t help but feel offended by that."

    scene ayanefitting8
    with dissolve

    mo "Don’t be. Yours are consistently the most enjoyable to grab. I mean measure. Which is what I’m doing. Measuring them. "
    s "I think Molly’s just a pervert."
    ay "She is. But as long as she gets my costume right, I don’t really care about how incorrect her methods are."

    scene ayanefitting9
    with dissolve

    mo "Worry not, Lidearel. I can assure you our group cosplay for this year’s Halloween party will be both my best work yet {i}and{/i} brimming with full-on lesbian energy."
    s "I once again remain adamant that Halloween is the best holiday."
    ay "I’m not really sure how much lesbian energy I can handle between the costumes and this club room."

    scene ayanefitting10
    with dissolve

    mo "Ahh. Is {i}that{/i} why you sided with those normie athletes instead of your companions in the manga club? Because of the amount of yuri power?"
    ay "Noooo...I just like swimming and staying active."
    mo "And using us for your own benefit when the time comes to look cute."

    scene ayanefitting11
    with dissolve

    ay "Joke’s on you, Molly. I always look cute. Plus, I have the perfect boobs according to whatever metric you use to rate them."
    s "They certainly are nice."
    ay "Thank you, Sensei. I am glad we’ve reached the point where you are able to compliment them in front of my friends."
    s "It’s just Molly. She’s not going to do anything."

    scene ayanefitting12
    with dissolve

    mo "Oi! What’s with this “Just Molly” crap? Shouldn’t ye’ be holdin’ me to the same standard everybody else is kept at?"
    s "Not when you’re even more of a degenerate than I am. "
    mo "Nobody is more of a degenerate than you, Sir."
    s "How many cartoons have you masturbated to now?"

    scene ayanefitting13
    with dissolve

    mo "Like...ever? Or...within a certain timeframe?"
    ay "It’s a weird day when I am somehow the least sexually charged person in the room."

    scene ayanefitting14
    with dissolve

    mo "Either way, we’re done for now. I got what I needed, so you can go ahead and put your clothes back on. Your {i}normie{/i} club is waiting for you, after all."
    ay "My normie club is taking the day off since Imani and Karin both had stuff to do today. But if you two wanted to come over to the pool and do a little swimming, I’m sure I can get us in."
    mo "Me? Swimming? Have you gone mad?"
    s "I would have agreed to come and watch if it was going to be both of you. But I can’t say I’m fond of the idea of just watching you swim by yourself. That sounds both extremely creepy and extremely lonely."

    scene ayanefitting15
    with dissolve

    ay "You guys are no fun. Is it really too much to ask to be covered in spandex and soaking wet with my teacher and an exchange student?"
    s "When you put it that way, probably."
    mo "Besides, I’ve got a batch of quests I need to be turnin’ in anyway. You two’ll be alone from here on out as Molly MacCormack is logging off."
    ay "But how are you going to turn your quests in if you-"
    mo "They’re in a different game, obviously."

    scene black
    with dissolve
    play sound "dooropen.mp3"

    mo "Farewell! And don’t forget to lock the door when you leave! There are collector's items in here!"

    "Molly exits the clubroom and I am, for probably the first time ever, the sole person inside who is actually {i}affiliated{/i} with it in some way."
    "Granted, this affiliation is still pretty new to me and I have no idea what it even entails, but still. "
    "Anyway, Ayane non-chalantly puts her clothes back on like I’ve watched her do a thousand times before and then slides a couple of chairs out from underneath the table for us to sit down on."

    scene ayanefitting16
    with dissolve2

    ay "So, how excited are you to see my costume on a scale of one to ten?"
    s "One being your suit of armor and ten being you...wearing absolutely nothing?"

    scene ayanefitting17
    with dissolve

    ay "Leave my armor alone. I looked gallant and beautiful and strong and-"
    s "And zero fuckable."

    scene ayanefitting18
    with dissolve

    ay "I’m zero fuckable now and you’re still spending time with me."
    s "Good point. See you later, Ayane. "
    ay "Ha ha ha. Very funny."
    ay "I think you’ll like this one, though. I’ll still be gallant and elegant, but I’ll be the type of gallant and elegant that you’ll want to ejaculate in."
    s "Halloween can’t come soon enough."
    s "I’m not sure how I feel about having two parties in such quick succession, though. What with everyone talking about the Dorm Wars making a return and whatnot."

    scene ayanefitting19
    with dissolve

    ay "Oh, has nobody told you yet? We’re combining them this year to save time. Especially since we still have both our annual beach trip {i}and{/i} Christmas party right around the corner as well."
    ay "Time can sure get pretty fucky because of this reset business, huh? I don’t remember ever feeling this...rushed before."
    s "I mean, it’s not like anything is going anywhere. We don’t have to rush if combining everything seems like it’s going to be stressful to plan since I know you like being involved in that sort of thing."

    scene ayanefitting20
    with dissolve

    ay "Nah...I’m sure it’ll be fine. We’ll just have to figure out the new contests as soon as possible since I’m pretty sure we’ll be changing most of them."
    ay "Match-ups too since losing to the same person two years in a row would probably make all of us feel like shit."
    s "Not out for ruthless...rap....revenge or whatever?"

    scene ayanefitting21
    with dissolve

    ay "Probably not. There’s no way I can compete with Uta without some serious training. And with the exception of Kirin, nobody is really looking for revenge on anyone."
    ay "In fact, both Maya and Makoto were extremely adamant about {i}not{/i} repeating the same contest two years in a row. Though, Makoto might still just be feeling kind of down."
    s "Anything you have your eye on, then? Anyone you’re looking to take down?"

    scene ayanefitting20
    with dissolve

    ay "Not off the top of my head. I’m sure something will come to me, though."
    ay "Or, who knows? Maybe not. Finding motivation at all lately has been damn near impossible. That’s why I’m hoping this party can get me back into the swing of things."
    s "Ayane-"
    ay "Don’t worry. I’m not going to talk your ear off again with more of my apocalyptic worries. I’ve been battering you with them pretty much every time we’ve talked lately and I don’t think either of us likes it."

    scene ayanefitting16
    with dissolve

    ay "I might ask you for a reward if I {i}do{/i} win, though. "
    s "A reward? What kind of reward?"
    ay "A date, maybe?"
    s "We’ve been on dates before, haven’t we?"
    ay "I guess. Maybe some sort of promise, then? Or...maybe a memento of yours that I can hang onto for good luck? I’m not really sure."
    ay "But I kind of need something to latch onto right now since latching onto the whole idea of the world being one big cycle isn’t good for me and you’re only a viable distraction when I can actually see you."
    ay "If there’s some sort of reward for me if I come out on top of my dorm war thingy...I feel like I’ll be able to look forward to it a little bit more. The issue is just figuring out what the reward should {i}be.{/i}"
    s "Well, what do you want it to be?"
    ay "Maybe an engagement ring?"
    s "Uh-huh. Anything else you had in mind?"

    scene ayanefitting21
    with dissolve

    ay "A...promise ring?"
    s "Isn’t that just an engagement ring for someone who’s too much of a pussy to actually propose?"
    ay "Well, it obviously has to be something involving you since that’s pretty much the only thing getting me out of bed at this point."

    scene ayanefitting19
    with dissolve

    ay "Oh! What if you be my slave for a day?"
    s "Are you into BDSM now? Because, if so, I think you’ve been spending too much time with Osako."
    ay "Are the rumors about Miss Watabe and Miss Osaka actually true?"
    s "Where did those rumors even come from?"
    ay "One of the girls in Class D works in the entertainment district and said she saw the two of them going into a love hotel carrying a pair of handcuffs."
    s "Maybe Osako just...fights crime?"
    ay "And Miss Watabe is her sidekick?"
    s "Seems plausible to me."
    ay "..."
    s "Or one of them was handcuffed to the bedpost and consensually abused for the next several hours."
    ay "That sounds more accurate. "

    scene ayanefitting20
    with dissolve

    ay "Anyway, there is {i}one{/i} thing I want from you. I’m just not sure if it’s something I want for my own peace of mind or if..."
    ay "If it’s something I want because I think it might make things a little bit easier for us."
    s "That’s..."
    s "I’m not really sure how to interpret that, actually."

    scene ayanefitting21
    with dissolve

    ay "That’s not your fault. I didn’t really know how to {i}say{/i} it."
    ay "How about this, then...if I win my contest this year...you can reward me by..."

    scene ayanefitting22
    with dissolve

    ay "By..."
    ay "Answering a question."
    s "That’s it?"
    ay "It’s a multi-layered and complicated question that could wind up changing everything, though. So I reserve the right to change my mind if I get scared and want to back down."
    s "Am I allowed to know the question ahead of time?"
    ay "Absolutely not. You’ll find out if I win. "
    s "I see..."
    s "I’ve got a question of my own then. Why ask {i}anything{/i} with that much potential for change? I figured you’d...want to avoid that, if at all possible."

    scene ayanefitting23
    with dissolve

    ay "Because everything {i}else{/i} is already changing. "
    ay "I figure slipping this question in might make it a little easier for me to adapt if I don’t like the answer."
    s "Not {i}everything{/i} is changing, though. We might not be able to have sex at the moment, but that doesn’t mean I don’t still-"
    ay "You love me and I love you. {i}That{/i} much hasn’t changed. But “everything” rarely means {i}everything{/i}. "
    ay "What it means in this context is that {i}I’m{/i} changing..."
    ay "Cracking under pressure..."
    ay "But most importantly..."

    scene ayanefitting24
    with dissolve

    ay "It means I’ve accepted that I’ve gotta grow up a little sooner than I wanted to."
    ay "It sucks, really. I like being a kid."
    ay "But I literally {i}can’t{/i} be a kid anymore if I want to maintain the life I have now. {i}Not{/i} changing and just going with the flow the way you do in the face of the end of days, is..."
    ay "That wouldn’t work for me."

    scene ayanefitting16
    with dissolve

    ay "I think I understand why Maya is the way she is now. "
    ay "And since I already promised I wouldn’t talk your ear off again, I’ll keep this as brief as I can."

    "If it were up to me to decide her fate and whether or not she ever {i}will{/i} lose me, of course I’d make it so she doesn’t."
    "But the sad truth is I have no power over that."
    "And neither does she."

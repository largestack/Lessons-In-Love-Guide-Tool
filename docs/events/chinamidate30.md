    "I still haven’t been paid for watching Chinami and company recently, so I figure that Chika at least owes me a discreet blowjob in the bathroom or something along those lines since she can’t actually {i}pay.{/i}"
    "But hey, I’m sure a blowjob from someone like her would be valued at quite a bit and that there would be plenty of people willing to pay for such a thing if they weren’t all dying out in space."
    "Anyway, time to fuck my fake girlfriend."

    c "How much longer, Chinami?"
    ch "Just a minute! Chinami is having trouble tying her shoes!"
    c "Do you need me to come in there and help you?"
    ch "Chinami can do it! She just needs patience!"
    c "Okay! Just let me know if-"
    s "Hello."

    scene chinamiwormparty2
    with dissolve

    c "Oh, hey! I didn’t even notice you there."
    s "Yeah, I kind of just show up sometimes."
    c "Hey, if there’s anybody I want to just randomly pop up throughout the day, it’s you. So you’re not going to hear any complaints from me."
    s "What’s Chinami doing here?"

    scene chinamiwormparty3
    with dissolve

    c "Just trying on some clothes and stuff. Yumi hasn’t come back yet, so she’s been alone a lot lately and it’s been a little while since the last time I brought her here."
    c "Figured I might as well buy her some new clothes while I’m at it."
    s "From here? I didn’t realize you were suddenly rich."
    c "Oh, no. Not from here. We bought her a new outfit from The Gap. But she still wanted to try on some of the clothes here so she could feel fancy."
    c "Chinami! Are you almost done? Sensei wants to say hi!"
    s "Actually, I was kind of hoping we could be {i}alone{/i} today if you catch my drift?"

    scene chinamiwormparty4
    with dissolve

    c "Here? But I thought you said stuff like that was too risky and that you wanted to slow down?"
    s "Yes, well I didn’t have a raging erection when I said that."

    scene chinamiwormparty5
    with dissolve

    c "Well, save that thing for later and come visit me again when my kid sister isn’t literally ten feet away. There’s no way I can get away right now. "
    s "Worst girlfriend ever."

    scene chinamiwormparty6
    with dissolve

    c "Oh, I’ll make it up to you. Don’t worry at all, Sensei."
    c "The truth is that I’ve also been craving your thick-"
    ch "Chinami is back!"

    scene chinamiwormparty7
    with hpunch

    c "Meatloaf!"
    s "Nice cover."
    ch "I didn’t know future Daddy could make meatloaf. "
    ch "How come he never brings his thick meatloaf to our house?"
    s "I didn’t like that sentence at all."
    c "Chinami, please don’t say “thick meatloaf” anymore. "
    ch "But big sister Chika sounded so excited when she was talking about Papa's thick meatloaf."
    c "Chinami, stop it."

    scene chinamiwormparty8
    with dissolve

    c "Wait, where is your helmet?! What do you think you’re doing coming out here without it on?! You could get sick."
    ch "But it’s so hot! Chinami is literally dying while she’s inside the helmet."
    s "Technically, we’re all “literally dying” every second of every day."

    scene chinamiwormparty9
    with dissolve

    ch "We are?! That’s Bad News Bears!"
    c "Did you just wake up today and decide to do everything within your power to make my life harder?"
    s "Of course not. If that were true, I’d have shown up here with my arm wrapped around Yumi."
    c "Hope you’re ready to fight off the Yakuza."
    ch "That’s even more Bad News Bears! Chinami knows something like that is called an affair now!"

    scene chinamiwormparty10
    with dissolve

    c "How does Chinami know that?!"
    ch "Because Tsukasa’s big sister is having an affair with everyone in town!"

    scene chinamiwormparty11
    with dissolve

    c "She is? But she seems so innocent. "
    ch "It’s totally crazy! And really Bad News Bears!"
    s "Why is Chinami’s catch phrase suddenly the title of a 1970’s baseball film?"
    c "Where did you hear that, Chinami? Did Tsukasa tell you? Because there’s barely ever any gossip I’m not in on and-"

    scene chinamiwormparty12
    with hpunch

    c "Wait a second! Stop talking and go get your helmet! "
    ch "Chinami is sorry! Please don’t have an affair while she’s gone!"

    scene chinamiwormparty13
    with dissolve

    "Chinami darts back into the dressing room, leaving me outside with both Chika and my raging hard-on (Yes, it is still there)."

    c "Sensei...why is my little sister suddenly talking about things she shouldn’t understand the meaning of for at least another...five thousand years?"
    s "It’s gotta be the Tskukiokas. They’re bad influences, I tell you."
    c "I’ll try to find time to scold Touka in between her apparent bang sessions with all of my neighbors."

    scene chinamiwormparty14
    with dissolve

    ch "Chinami is back and doggier than ever."
    s "I don’t think your “dog” level has increased just because you got a new outfit."
    ch "Right! Chinami got a new outfit! What do you think, future Daddy? Is Chinami super cute?"
    s "Sure. Why not?"
    ch "Wouldn’t she be cuter {i}without{/i} the helmet?"
    c "The helmet stays on, Chinami. I don’t want you getting sick and you’ve already been exposed to more people than normal lately."
    ch "That’s okay! Tsukasa’s big sister washed her hands many, many times while she was at the house! She did it after almost everything she touched! It was really weird."
    s "I think that was just Touka’s inherent lack of knowledge in the face of poverty compelling her to practice better hygiene when in places she expects to be less...clean."
    ch "Maybe! Chinami only understood half of that sentence, so she doesn’t really know."
    c "Are you hungry yet, Chinami? It’s about time for me to go on break. And I still need to pay Sensei back for watching you the other day, so I can get him lunch while we’re out as well."
    s "I was kind of hoping {i}the other thing{/i} would be my payment."

    scene chinamiwormparty15
    with dissolve

    c "You mean the thing I will do literally whenever, {i}wherever{/i} so long as there isn’t a girl wearing a dog mask several feet away from us?"
    s "Chinami, take off the mask. It’s for a good cause."
    ch "If that’s what future Daddy says, Chinami has to listen!"

    scene chinamiwormparty16
    with dissolve

    c "Don’t you dare. You so much as reach for that mask and I’m taking you to the kennel."
    ch "But the other dogs don’t like Chinami! She’s too big and hasn’t learned their language yet!"

    scene black
    with dissolve2

    "Begrudgingly, Chinami keeps the mask on as Chika clocks out for her break and begins to lead us over to the mall’s food court."
    "Things are a little busy once we get there as it seems that people from many of the other shops are starting to take their breaks as well but, despite that, no one really pays any attention to Chinami."
    "I don’t know if the novelty of seeing a little girl in a dog mask has just worn out for all of these people but, at least to me, knowing we’re not the center of attention is good."

    scene chinamiwormparty17
    stop music

    "{b}Because that means no one will see anything I do to them.{/b}"

    scene chinamiwormparty18
    play music "mall.mp3"

    ch "If Chinami could have any superpower, it would be to drink things with her hands. That way, she wouldn’t feel completely helpless right now!"
    c "Can’t you fit your milk inside of the helmet? "
    ch "Last time Chinami tried that, she made a huge mess. And she doesn’t want to ruin her brand new clothes the first time she wears them."
    c "Well, keep it on while we’re in the food court. Once our food comes, I’ll let you take the helmet off in the office at my store where I can make sure everything is safe."
    ch "Will Chinami ever get to come to the mall without her helmet on?"
    c "One day when your immune system is stronger, sure. But right now, you’re still young and shrimpy and need to be extra careful so you don’t get sick."
    ch "Chinami doesn’t like it, but she understands. "
    ch "She will just try to absorb the milk through osmosis so everyone can be happy."
    c "Good girl. Maybe after I get out we can go look for a mask that’s a little less hot? It’s almost October, so Spirit Halloween is probably going to be putting up shops all around our house before we know it."
    s "I didn’t realize they were so popular in the old district."

    scene chinamiwormparty19
    with dissolve

    c "Wherever there are unused storefronts, there will {i}always{/i} be a Spirit Halloween."
    c "Spirit Halloween, for all of your Halloween related needs."

    s "Did anyone else see that just now?"
    c "Hm? See what?"
    ch "Chinami hasn’t seen {i}anything{/i} in ten whole minutes!"
    c "Hang in there, Sensei. I’m pretty sure all of that, uhh...{i}redirected bloodflow{/i} might be making you a little lightheaded right now. "
    c "You seem kinda pale too. Want me to get you a bottle of water or something? I’m friends with the girl working the sushi place right now so I can get you one for free if you want."
    s "You don’t need to-"
    c "Sensei, it’s fine. I’m going to have to head over there to pick up our food in a few minutes anyway. And I have, like...zero clue what I’d do if you were to pass out in front of me."
    s "You could always help re-{i}re{/i}-redirect some of my bloodflow, Chika. That would probably help a little more than water."
    c "Would it really, though?"
    s "{s}Fuck me while she can’t see us.{/s} Yes."
    c "Would it really though? "
    s "{s}I will wrap my hands around your throat and makes your eyes roll back.{/s} Yes."
    c "Would it really though? "
    s "{s}DO YOU think I WILL NOT take you here???{/s} Yes."
    c "{b}WILL IT REALLY THOUGH???????????????{/b}"
    s "{s}DO YOU THINK I WILL NOT TAKE HER AS WELL???{/s} Yes."

    ch "Arf!"
    s "Huh? Where did Chika go?"
    ch "Big sis Chika went to go get you water. Chinami decided to bark since you weren’t saying anything."
    ch "You need to be careful, future Daddy. She might make you start wearing a mask soon too if you don’t start acting like you’re okay!"
    s "I...think I’ll be fine without a mask, Chinami."
    ch "Chinami thinks she’ll be fine without a mask too!"
    s "Too bad that Chinami has to-"

    with dissolve

    ch "Gehh..."

    "Oh no. I’m the bad parent."

    ch "Chinami...is finally free..."
    s "Chinami, you’re going to get {i}both{/i} of us in trouble if you don’t put that back on."

    scene chinamiwormparty23
    with dissolve

    ch "I seriously can’t do it anymore! It’s too hot and I’m going to pass out if I stay in there any longer! "
    ch "There’s nobody else around! At least let me breathe for a few seconds until Onee-chan comes back!"
    s "Who are you and why are you talking like that?"
    ch "Uhhhhh..."

    scene chinamiwormparty24
    with dissolve

    ch "Arf?"
    s "I’m...going to ignore that momentary lapse in character and chalk it up to the early stages of heatstroke. So...fine. "
    s "You can keep it off. But as soon as Chika turns around, you’re putting it back on. I am not risking my {i}plans{/i} for later tonight just because you think it’s important to {i}breathe.{/i}"

    scene chinamiwormparty25
    with fade

    ch "Chinami thanks you for your kindness, future Daddy. She promises she won’t ask you what your plans for later tonight are either."
    s "Good because I have no idea how I would even explain them to you."
    ch "Chinami is smarter than she looks, you know. She can do ten times ten in her head. She can even say her phone number with her eyes closed."
    s "That last one isn’t that impressive."

    scene chinamiwormparty26
    with dissolve

    ch "Chinami doesn’t like when future Daddy doesn’t believe she’s super awesome and smart."
    s "And {i}I{/i} don’t like being repeatedly referred to as “future Daddy” despite having no real intention of becoming your father."
    ch "Chinami thinks this is called a crossroads and that we should both agree to talk about something more fun. Like giraffes or rabbits."
    s "How about we talk about why you’re suddenly tired of your helmet when I thought you loved it?"

    scene chinamiwormparty27
    with dissolve

    ch "Chinami does love her dog helmet! She just wishes it had air conditioning!"
    ch "Do you even watch the news?! This is supposed to be the hottest summer ever! Get your head out of the super hot clouds and read a paper or something!"
    s "No one reads the paper anymore, Chinami."
    ch "No wonder why society is collapsing! "
    s "I think the collapse of society runs a little deeper than the death of print, but that’s not something I should be getting into with a literal child."

    scene chinamiwormparty28
    with dissolve

    ch "Arf. Arf arf arf. Arf arf arf arf."
    s "What are you saying right now?"
    ch "Chinami is discussing climate change with her disembodied head. She does this sometimes when she feels there aren’t enough intellectuals around."
    s "Wow, I sure hope Chika comes back soon so you can go back to not breathing."

    scene chinamiwormparty29
    with dissolve

    ch "Do you really think it’s fair that Chinami has to wear this {i}all{/i} the time? She understands what’s safe and when to be careful. "
    s "It’s not {i}all{/i} the time, it’s just...whenever you’re out in public. And it’s for your own good, isn’t it?"
    ch "What good is a life that’s no fun?! Chinami wants to see what everybody else sees so that she doesn’t have any regrets when she’s finally gone! And Chinami can’t see anything in there!"
    s "It’s far too early to talk about being {i}gone,{/i} Chinami. Like Chika said, your immune system could get stronger one day and-"
    ch "But what if it doesn’t?"
    s "..."

    "Chinami quickly shoves the dog helmet back on top of her head just seconds before Chika looks up from the tray carrying all of our lunches."
    "When she returns to the table, she thanks Chinami for being such a good girl and listening to her big sister."
    "She offers to buy her ice cream on the way home and I have to nod and agree with everything Chika says so Chinami’s secret stays safe."
    "Or at least {i}one{/i} of her secrets. "
    "Among the sea of noise pouring from the mall’s loudspeakers, I hear something on the way back to the boutique."

    stop music
